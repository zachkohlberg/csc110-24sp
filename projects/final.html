<p>The final project is a completely open-ended assignment. You will design a
program that you would like to build in Java, submit a proposal for approval,
and then create your program.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives"><a class="header" href="#learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Design and write a Java program from scratch</li>
<li>Research a new feature of the Java programming language</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tasks"><a class="header" href="#tasks">Tasks</a></h2>
<h3 id="task-1-design-and-research"><a class="header" href="#task-1-design-and-research">Task 1: Design and Research</a></h3>
<h4 id="pick-an-idea"><a class="header" href="#pick-an-idea">Pick an Idea</a></h4>
<p>The first thing you need to do is decide what kind of program you will create.
This can be <em>anything</em>, so choose something that you find interesting and will
either enjoy working on or enjoy using once it's complete.</p>
<p>Many students struggle to come up with ideas when starting this project. If
you're not sure what to do, then I recommend beginning with a list of your
hobbies and interests. Consider how programming can be combined with one of
those topics or what kind of program you might find useful when engaging with
that hobby/interest. <strong>Do not ask me to suggest a topic for you.</strong> I'm happy to
discuss ideas that you're considering or discuss how you might apply your
programming skills to a particular topic, but you need to come up with ideas
and choose one that's appealing to you.</p>
<p>This project is meant to challenge you, so I expect the proposed program to be
similar in scope and complexity to the program you created for projects 1.3 or
2.3. I will not approve your proposal if the program appears too small to be a
challenge, and I will be reluctant to approve any projects that I don't think
can reasonably be finished in 2-4 weeks.</p>
<h4 id="pick-a-research-topic"><a class="header" href="#pick-a-research-topic">Pick a Research Topic</a></h4>
<p>The second thing you need to do is find a topic to research that will help you
create this program. I want you to spend some time learning about a feature of
the Java programming language or a part of the standard library that we haven't
covered in class. You could also choose something we have covered in class, but
that you would like to learn more about.</p>
<p>You shouldn't choose an arbitrary topic. Consider what features you might want
to include in your program and what you might need to learn to implement those
features. Chances are, you'll find several potential research topics by doing
this.</p>
<p>You might also already have a topic that really interests you. If you're more
motivated to learn about multi-threading, for example, than you are to write a
particular program, then it's fine to start with a research topic that you
really like and make up an idea for a program that will let you learn about
your research topic.</p>
<h4 id="research"><a class="header" href="#research">Research</a></h4>
<p>I expect you to have researched your topic before you send me your proposal
(task 2). However, once you have your program idea and topic, you might want to
discuss them with me before you start on the research. I can't pre-approve your
proposal, but I can tell you whether I think the program and topic are
appropriate for CSC110 and reasonable in scope.</p>
<p>Research can include looking up tutorials, reading a textbook, reading the Java
documentation, or just experimenting on your own. All I want you to do is
choose a programming topic and learn about it on your own.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-proposal"><a class="header" href="#task-2-proposal">Task 2: Proposal</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a proposal describing your project. Your proposal should be
approved before you begin working on the program, and I will not accept any
program submissions unless the proposal for that program was approved at least
one week prior to the submission.</p>
<p>A final project proposal must include the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Summarize the program you intend to write. Tell me enough about the program
that I'll understand what it does and why I or another person might want to
use it.</li>
<li>Why is this project interesting to you and what made you want to work on it?
Does it relate to your hobbies or interests outside of programming?</li>
<li>Tell me about the topic you researched for this project and how you expect
to use it in your program.
<ul>
<li>What is the topic?</li>
<li>What did you know about the topic before starting this project?</li>
<li>What have you learned about the topic from your research?</li>
<li>How will it be used to write your program?</li>
<li>Include a short example program demonstrating how you expect to make use
of this topic in your project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>List all of your deliverables for this project. This means everything I
should expect you to send me when you submit the finished project. At a
minimum, this will include all of your source code and a writeup.</li>
<li>Describe the project's essential features in detail. You must clearly
explain each feature and what I should expect to see when I run the program.
You must include enough information for me or anyone reading the proposal to
determine whether you've implemented the features correctly in your finished
program. <em>I will use this section to determine whether your project is
complete, and I will not approve a proposal that doesn't include enough
information for me to evaluate your project.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I will aim to give feedback on all proposals within one week of their
submission. Remember that you may also need to revise your proposal before I
approve it, so you should submit the proposal at least a week before you plan
to start working on the program. If you wait until shortly before the project
deadline to submit a proposal, then you should not expect me to approve your
project in time for you to submit it and receive credit.</p>
<h4 id="proposal-revisions"><a class="header" href="#proposal-revisions">Proposal Revisions</a></h4>
<p>At any point before you submit the project, you're free to submit a revised
proposal. An open-ended project like this will rarely go the way you expected
when you began, and you may decide the initial idea isn't as interesting as you
thought it would be or think of a better idea after you get started. I will
review and either approve it or ask for changes just like your initial
proposal.</p>
<h4 id="proposal-deadline"><a class="header" href="#proposal-deadline">Proposal Deadline</a></h4>
<p>While I'm not giving you a fixed deadline for proposals, I have one restriction
on how late you can submit them: your approved proposal must be submitted at
least one week before you submit the project. This also applies to proposal
revisions: if I approve a revised proposal, then you cannot submit your project
until at least one week after you submitted the revised proposal.</p>
<p>Just in case my wording above is unclear, here's an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You submit a proposal April 2nd.</li>
<li>I review it April 6th and request changes.</li>
<li>You revise and resubmit the proposal April 10th.</li>
<li>I review it April 12th and approve it.</li>
<li>In this scenario, April 17th is one week after you submitted a proposal that
I approved. That's the earliest you would be allowed to submit the project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-3-program"><a class="header" href="#task-3-program">Task 3: Program</a></h3>
<p>If your proposal has been approved, then you can go ahead and write your
program. It must include the essential features described in your proposal and
make use of your research topic as described in your proposal.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a document (preferably a PDF) with your program that contains
the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instructions for using the program. These must be accurate and include
sufficient detail for someone unfamiliar with your program to use all of its
features. You do not need to explain how to compile it unless it involves
more than running <code>javac</code> on the source code (for example, if the user must
import a third-party library that your program uses).</li>
<li>A description of how your research topic was used in the program. Include
and explain at least one example from your project's source code.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion).
Explain why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend
more time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverables"><a class="header" href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>
<p>This is covered by your proposal.</p>
<h2 id="group-final-projects"><a class="header" href="#group-final-projects">Group Final Projects</a></h2>
<p>If you would like to work on this project with one or more other students, then
you can submit a group proposal. I will expect significantly more out of group
projects. Below is a list of changes to the project requirements.</p>
<h3 id="group-proposal"><a class="header" href="#group-proposal">Group Proposal</a></h3>
<p>If you are submitting a group proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each group member must choose their own different research topic (and
research it) before you write your proposal.</li>
<li>Each group member must write their own separate answers to questions two and
three. The group proposal must include each member's answers to these
questions.</li>
<li>Each essential feature for question five must designate one group member as
the person primarily responsible for implementing that feature. You aren't
committed to dividing up the work this way, but I want you to put some
thought into how the work will be divided before you begin the project.</li>
<li>Earlier in this assignment, I said &quot;I expect the proposed program to be
similar in scope and complexity to the program you created for projects 1.3
or 2.3.&quot; A group project should be somewhat greater in scope and complexity
than projects 1.3 and 2.3.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-work"><a class="header" href="#group-work">Group Work</a></h3>
<p>When you are working on the program, your group must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that each member contributes a similar amount of work to the other
members. It is not acceptable for one group member to contribute
significantly more work than the other members or for one group member to
contribute significantly less work than the other members.</li>
<li>Keep track of each individual member's significant contributions to the
project.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is a shared responsibility</strong>, and it requires regular communication
within your group. If you cannot communicate with your group members enough to
divide work evenly and keep track of individual contributions, then you cannot
work as a group on this project.</p>
<p>I also do not care whether you're the one leaving most of the work to the rest
of your group, the one doing twice as much work as everyone else, or a
bystander watching this imbalance take place. All of these are unacceptable. If
you decide to work as a group, then you are accepting some responsibility for
your group members. Don't work with people who you don't trust to be good group
members, and don't remain with a group if you feel the other members are not
meeting their obligations to the rest of the group.</p>
<h3 id="group-write-up"><a class="header" href="#group-write-up">Group Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a group write-up that covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question one (the instructions) from the original write-up</li>
<li>The record of individual contributions mentioned earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>Each group member must submit their own individual write-up that covers the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remaining questions from the original write-up</li>
<li>A summary of your contributions to the group</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-submission"><a class="header" href="#group-submission">Group Submission</a></h3>
<p>I only need one submission with the group write-up and all other deliverables
listed in your proposal. The individual write-ups can be submitted by each
group member separately or included with the group submission.</p>
