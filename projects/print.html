<p>This book contains all of the projects for CSC110. The projects are organized
into chapters by topic (<a href="./project1.html">Project 1: Character Sheet</a>, <a href="./project2.html">Project
2: Dice Game</a>, <a href="./project3.html">Project 3: Connect Four</a>, and the
<a href="./final.html">Final Project</a>. They can also be grouped by grade contract:</p>
<ul>
<li>The C contract requires all guided projects:
<ul>
<li><a href="./project1/part1.html">Guided Project 1.1</a></li>
<li><a href="./project1/part2.html">Guided Project 1.2</a></li>
<li><a href="./project2/part1.html">Guided Project 2.1</a></li>
<li><a href="./project2/part2.html">Guided Project 2.2</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The B contract requires the expanded projects in addition to the guided
projects:
<ul>
<li><a href="./project1/part3.html">Expanded Project 1.3</a></li>
<li><a href="./project2/part3.html">Expanded Project 2.3</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The A contract requires the final project in addition to the guided and
expanded projects:
<ul>
<li><a href="./final.html">Final Project</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a page that describes how to propose a <a href="./expanded_mod.html">modified
project</a>. This is relevant if you would like to replace one
of the expanded projects, or in rare cases replace the guided projects.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Projects 3.1 and 3.2 have been cut from the required work for this
semester. I will still post those assignments when they are ready, but they
have no impact on your final grade whether you complete or skip them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-directory-setup"><a class="header" href="#project-directory-setup">Project Directory Setup</a></h1>
<p>Before you start working on any projects, you should create folders to store
your project files. I would like you to use a specific structure for a few
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will give you test code for the Guided Projects. This test code expects
your projects to be organized a certain way. You may not be able to run the
tests if you don't organize your projects as shown below.</li>
<li>When I download projects from Blackboard, I process them automatically with
some scripts. This saves me hours of organizing and renaming everyone's files
throughout the semester. My scripts also handle testing the Guided Projects,
and they'll use the same test code I give you. If your submission isn't
organized correctly, then my scripts will not be able to extract the project
files and run the relevant tests, and your submission will be marked
incomplete.</li>
<li>Keeping your work organized will make it easier for <em>you</em> to keep track of
everything.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-directory-structure"><a class="header" href="#project-directory-structure">Project Directory Structure</a></h2>
<p>Your project directory should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>projects/
├── final/
├── project1/
│   ├── part1/
│   ├── part2/
│   └── part3/
├── project2/
│   ├── part1/
│   ├── part2/
│   └── part3/
├── project3/
│   ├── part1/
│   └── part2/
└── tests/
</code></pre>
<p>Everything you need to submit should go in the folder for that project. For
example, your code for Guided Project 1.1 would go in the folder
<code>projects/project1/part1</code>. Each folder name must only contain lowercase
letters, and the spelling must match exactly what is shown above. Ignore the
<code>/</code> at the end of each name; this is to indicate that the name refers to a
directory rather than a regular file.</p>
<p>You can create these directories by hand from your file browser, but it's
easier to use the terminal. The following commands create all dozen or so
folders with the correct names, and they will work in most Mac/Linux terminals.
If you're on Windows, then read the terminal section of the notes and follow
the directions for getting a terminal emulator that can run bash commands. The
default Windows terminals (cmd and powershell) will not be able to run most
bash commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir projects
cd projects
mkdir -p final project{1,2,3}/part{1,2} project{1,2}/part3
</code></pre>
<p>The name of the root folder (<code>projects</code>) doesn't technically matter, so you can
use a different name. Just change the name <code>projects</code> in the first two commands
to your new folder name, but make sure it doesn't contain any spaces.</p>
<p>You don't need to create the <code>tests</code> folder right now. It will be created when
you download the test code and extract the contents.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-set-1-character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#project-set-1-character-sheet">Project Set 1: Character Sheet</a></h1>
<p>For this project, we will write a program that asks the user for information
about a Dungeons and Dragons 5e character and prints them a character sheet.</p>
<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop roleplaying game</a> (TTRPG). It's probably
the most widely-known TTRPG at time of writing, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tabletop_role-playing_games">many others exist</a>. This
assignment will use a modified version of some of the character creation rules
for D&amp;D 5e. The real rules can be found in the <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/">5e System Reference Document</a> (SRD), which you can read if you're curious and want to
learn more.</p>
<p>I'm going to summarize a few relevant terms here so that they make more sense
when they come up in the assignment later. Some of these are probably obvious,
but I don't want to assume any familiarity with games.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>player</strong> is a real person playing the game.</li>
<li>A <strong>character</strong> is a fictional character in the game. Our program will help a
player create their own character for a hypothetical TTRPG, which we might
refer to as a <strong>player character</strong> or <strong>PC</strong>.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>class</strong> is the role they fill in the game's world. In a game
like D&amp;D, which focuses on fighting fantasy monsters, a character's class
tells us their role in combat. A wizard casts spells, a rogue sneaks up and
surprises enemies, and a fighter wears armor and hits things with a sword.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ancestry</strong> or <strong>race</strong> (the term varies by game, but I'll
usually go with ancestry when not talking about a specific game) represents
what kind of creature they are. Standard D&amp;D races include elf, human, dwarf,
goblin, gnome, halfling, and orc. However, depending on the game and who's
running it, a TTRPG character could be anything: a ghost, a dragon, a talking
bear, or a mannequin.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>HP</strong> or <strong>hit points</strong> represent how difficult they are to
kill or incapacitate in combat.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>AC</strong> or <strong>armor class</strong> represents how hard they are to hit
with an attack. This represents a combination of their ability to avoid
attacks (by dodging, blocking, or parrying) and their armor's ability to
outright negate an attack that would otherwise hit them.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability scores</strong> are numbers that represent a character's
strength, cunning, speed, and other qualities that affect most of the actions
they can take in the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability modifiers</strong> are bonuses or penalties derived from
their ability scores. The modifiers are the numbers we actually use in most
calculations, and the scores only exist to determine the modifiers. At this
point, you may be wondering why we bother with the ability scores at all if
we don't use them after calculating the modifiers. That's an excellent
question!</li>
<li>A character's <strong>level</strong> represents how powerful and experienced they are. In
most RPGs, characters gain experience and level up to represent how they've
become stronger during their adventures. No, I'm not planning to answer my
previous question about why ability scores exist. Yes, it will be on the
exam.</li>
<li>In addition to standard six-sided dice (referred to as D6 dice), D&amp;D uses
several less common dice shapes: D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="parts"><a class="header" href="#parts">Parts</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="./project1/part1.html">Guided Project 1.1</a>: Create a simple character sheet
using a jshell script that reads a few pieces of user input.</li>
<li><a href="./project1/part2.html">Guided Project 1.2</a>: Use more input to create the
character sheet, implement rules that are closer to the real D&amp;D character
creation rules, and improve the output formatting.</li>
<li><a href="./project1/part3.html">Expanded Project 1.3</a>: Redesign the character creation
rules, implement more interesting stat generation methods, and make part of
the program more user-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="guided-project-11"><a class="header" href="#guided-project-11">Guided Project 1.1</a></h1>
<p>This program will prompt the user for a few pieces of information about their
character, calculate some additional stats, and then print a character sheet.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives"><a class="header" href="#learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use I/O functions in a Jshell script to interact with the user</li>
<li>Use variables to store user input</li>
<li>Use variables in simple calculations</li>
<li>Use variables in a program's output</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites-and-setup"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites-and-setup">Prerequisites and Setup</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a file named <code>CharacterSheet1.jsh</code> in your <code>project1/part1</code> folder.</li>

<h2 id="tasks"><a class="header" href="#tasks">Tasks</a></h2>
<h3 id="task-1-guided-coding"><a class="header" href="#task-1-guided-coding">Task 1: Guided Coding</a></h3>
<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>I recommend using comments to divide your program into sections so that it's
easier to stay organized. I'll be referring to three different parts of the
program in these steps: input, calculations, and output. Before the input
section, add comments with a title for the program and the author's name
(that's you). Feel free to copy the template below and fill in the missing
information.</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>In the input section, prompt the user for the following information in
order: their name, their character's name, their character's level, and
their character's ability scores (strength, dexterity, and constitution).
When you prompt the user for input, remember that this involves two lines of
code:
<ul>
<li>A <code>println</code> to ask the user for input. You want the user to know that
they're expected to type something, and you want them to know <em>what</em>
they're expected to type. You can word this however you want. This
project's requirements do not specify the wording of any prompts, and the
tests will not check your prompts.</li>
<li>Declare a new variable to hold the input value and initialize it by
calling the appropriate input function (in this project, we will only use
<code>nextLine</code> and <code>nextInt</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test your program. You should see the first input prompt, and then the
program should pause until you enter your input before moving to the next
prompt. After all of the prompts finish, you'll be left in Jshell. Try
entering the name of each variable you created. You should see the values
you typed earlier when the program was asking you for input.</li>
<li>In the calculations section, calculate the character's HP (hit points), AC
(armor class), and attack bonus. Each of these properties should be a new
variable. Test your program after you finish and check the values of the hp,
ac, and attack bonus variables. Do the calculations yourself to confirm the
values shown in jshell are correct. Use the following formulas to calculate
these properties:
<ul>
<li>The character's HP is equal to their level multiplied by their
constitution score.</li>
<li>The character's AC is equal to ten plus their dexterity score.</li>
<li>The character's attack bonus is equal to their level plus their strength
score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print all of the information shown in the I/O Format section. You can insert
your variable into the output using string concatenation: write the label as
a string literal, then add the appropriate variable. For example, if your
player's name is in a variable called <code>playerName</code>, then you could print
<code>&quot;Player: &quot; + playerName</code> for the first line of the character sheet.</li>
<li>Before you run my test program, try running your program yourself and make
sure the output looks correct. It will be nice to see the whole program
working, and you can spot the more obvious mistakes on your own.</li>

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This program requires two additional pieces of input. Prompt the player for
their character's ancestry and class after the character name and before the
level. Test these new prompts like you tested the prompts in 1.1: run the
program, make sure the prompts appear, and make sure the variables have the
expected value after all of the prompts are finished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the user enters invalid input, then our program must print an error
message and exit. You should modify your prompts to tell the user what input
is allowed for the ancestry, class, level, and ability scores. This will be
a helpful reminder when you test the program.</p>
<p>Note: You can check each input value immediately after the prompt, or you
can check all of them in a separate section of your program after all of the
input is finished. The first option will give a better user experience
because you will know right away when you make a mistake, and you won't
waste time entering more input before the program exits. It also makes your
program faster to test for the same reasons. The second option makes it a
little easier to organize the code, and all of the error-checking could be
combined into one if statement. I recommend the first option because I
believe you'll benefit the most from the ease of testing. My directions will
only describe how to code this option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an if statement after the level prompt. A <em>valid</em> level is an integer
between 1 and 20, inclusive. We want to check whether it is <em>invalid</em>, so we
need a condition that asks whether the level is outside of this range. An
invalid level is <strong>either</strong> less than 1 <strong>or</strong> greater than 20. There are
two parts to this condition, so we need to join them with an AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) or
an OR (<code>||</code>). In this case, we should use OR. There are a couple of ways to
determine that OR is appropriate: the wording of the condition when we
describe it in English only makes sense with the word &quot;or&quot;, and we only need
to meet one of these two conditions for the level to be invalid (it's not
even possible for it to be both less than 1 and greater than 20 at the same
time). In the body of our if statement, we need to print an error message
and exit our program. The exact error message is <code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code>, and
we can exit the program with <code>System.exit(1);</code>. Any integer is a valid
argument for the <code>System.exit</code> function, but a value other than 0 means the
program encountered an error. All together, the prompt with error checking
would look something like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// prompt for input
System.out.println(&quot;level prompt message&quot;);
int variableName = nextInt();

// check for invalid input
if (/*TODO: condition*/) {
    println(&quot;ERROR: INVALID INPUT&quot;);
    // The /exit command won't work here because this whole block is part of a
    // Java code snippet. Jshell expects everything in a snippet to be valid
    // Java code.
    exit(1);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>You can use a similar prompt to check each ability score. The ability scores
must be integers between 8 and 15 inclusive. After you add the
error-checking for the level and abilities, you should test each of them a
few times. Try a few values inside and outside the range, and make sure the
program exits with the error message if and only if you enter a value
outside the range. In particular, you should check the boundaries of the
range. One of the most common mistakes in this type of code is to make a
range inclusive when it should have been exclusive, or to make it exclusive
when it should have been inclusive. If you make that mistake, then your code
will work correctly for all but one or two numbers. You should check 0, 1,
20, and 21 for the level, as well as 7, 8, 15, and 16 for each ability
score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once your error-checking code works for the numbers, you also need to check
the ancestry and class. Each of these have three options, and the user's
input is invalid if it is not equal to one of these options. This means we
have three parts to our condition, and they must be joined with AND or OR.
Which is appropriate? Let's try describing invalid input more closely to how
we would code it (checking each possibility separately) and see whether AND
or OR is more natural: an invalid ancestry is <strong>not</strong> an elf <strong>and</strong> it is
<strong>not</strong> a dwarf <strong>and</strong> it is <strong>not</strong> a human. Therefore we should use AND
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</p>
<p>However, this can be tricky. There's another way to phrase our condition
that sounds natural and uses OR instead of AND: &quot;an invalid ancestry is not
an elf, dwarf, <strong>or</strong> human&quot;. Does this mean it doesn't matter whether we
use AND or OR? No, it still matters. The trick with this phrase is how it
looks when structured like code: &quot;it is <strong>not</strong> true that (an invalid
ancestry is an elf <strong>or</strong> it is a dwarf <strong>or</strong> it is a human).&quot; We are using
<strong>or</strong> to join several equality checks (instead of inequality checks), then
applying the NOT (<code>!</code>) to the entire expression, which I've indicated by
wrapping most of the expression in parenthesis.</p>
<p>You'll develop an intuition for boolean logic with practice, so don't worry
if you had a hard time with this part. I'll summarize everything you need to
know for the AND solution to this error check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether the ancestry/class is NOT equal to each option.</li>
<li>Join each of these comparisons with AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</li>
<li>Never compare strings with <code>s1 == s2</code> or <code>s1 != s2</code>. This will not work
as you want it to. Instead, compare them using the <code>.equals</code> function:
<code>s1.equals(s2)</code> for equality and <code>!s1.equals(s2)</code> for inequality.</li>
<li>Valid ancestries are &quot;elf&quot;, &quot;human&quot;, and &quot;dwarf&quot;.</li>
<li>Valid classes are &quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;rogue&quot;, and &quot;ranger&quot;.</li>
<li>Use the lowercase versions of these names. You're free to assume all the
user's input for class and ancestry will be lowercase, and I will only
use lowercase input for these traits when testing your code. However, if
you want your program to ignore case, then you can modify the code that
reads their input for class and ancestry by changing <code>nextLine()</code> to
<code>nextLine().toLowerCase()</code>. This will convert any capital letters in the
user input to lowercase letters. Another solution is to use
<code>.equalsIgnoreCase</code> instead of <code>.equals</code>, which will let you check for
equality while preserving the user's capitalization. If we use
<code>.equalsIgnoreCase</code> and don't convert the input to lowercase, then our
output will use the same capitalization as the user. This may or may not
be desirable; it depends on how you want the output to look.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to test your new error-checking code. You should now get an error
message if you don't enter a valid ancestry or class, but the program should
still work if you enter valid input for everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we need to update the calculations. We can break this into three phases:
adjust ability scores, calculate ability modifiers, and calculate other
values. We'll start with adjusting the ability scores. Each ancestry changes
one or more ability scores. Humans increase all of their scores by 1, elves
increase their dexterity by 2, and dwarves increase their constitution by 2.
You can structure this part as an else-if chain:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (variableName.equals(&quot;ancestry1&quot;)) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 1
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;ancestry2&quot;)) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 2
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;ancestry3&quot;)) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 3
} else {
    // We don't need this, but it can make debugging easier. If we made a
    // mistake in our error-checking code and allowed an invalid ancestry, or
    // if we add more ancestries later and forget to update this part, then
    // we'll see this error message and know we made a mistake. This error
    // message is for us, not the user. We should only see it if our code is
    // wrong.
    println(&quot;ERROR: UNRECOGNIZED ANCESTRY! SKIPPING ADJUSTMENTS&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>After you adjust ability scores for the character's ancestry, you need to
calculate each ability's modifier. This is a separate number from the score,
and it's used in most calculations that care about the ability instead of
the raw score. The <a href="project1/../project1.html#background">Project 1 Background</a> section
explains the difference between ability scores and modifiers in more detail.</p>
<p>The SRD has a table showing the modifier for each ability score. However, we
can more easily calculate this with a short formula: <code>abilityModifier = (abilityScore / 2) - 5</code>. The parenthesis aren't necessary, but they
emphasize the order of operations. Dividing after subtraction
(<code>(abilityScore - 10) / 2</code>) would not give us the correct modifier for some
scores below ten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="project1/part2.html#calculations">Calculations</a> section covers the remaining calculations
you need to perform. You can find the relevant formulas and other
information there. Some of these calculations change depending on the class,
so you should use an else-if chain similar to what you wrote for the
ancestry adjustments. However, make sure you declare any variables <em>before</em>
the start of the if-else chain. If you declare a variable inside an if or
else body, then that variable will only exist inside that code block, and it
won't be available later when you perform other calculations or print your
output. Here's an outline to get started:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Declare all new variables here
int hp = 0;
// TODO: other variables

if (variableName.equals(&quot;class1&quot;)) {
    hp = /*TODO: class 1 hp calculations*/;
    // TODO: other class 1 calculations
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;class2&quot;)) {
    // TODO: class 2 calculations
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;class3&quot;)) {
    // TODO: class 3 calculations
} else {
    // As with the ancestry section, the extra else can help with debugging
    println(&quot;ERROR: UNRECOGNIZED CLASS! SKIPPING CALCULATIONS&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>Test your code. We haven't updated the output yet, but you can run the
program and check the value of each variable from the calculations section
to make sure it's what you were expecting.</li>
<li>Finally, you can adjust the output to follow the <a href="project1/part2.html#io-format">new format</a>
for 1.2 and show all of the new information you've calculated. Two of the
formatting requirements can be tricky to figure out: adding a plus to any
nonnegative modifiers and right-aligning the ability scores. You can use if
statements to handle this, but the <code>printf</code> function solves this problem
much more easily than an if statement. I won't explain <code>printf</code> here, so
read the notes if you aren't familiar with it. The formatting specifiers
you'll need are <code>%2d</code> to right-align an ability score and <code>%+d</code> to force a
plus or minus sign in front of an ability modifier.</li>

<p>A Guided Project program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's ancestry (String)</li>
<li>The character's class (String)</li>
<li>The character's level (int)</li>
<li>The character's ability scores
<ul>
<li>Strength (int)</li>
<li>Dexterity (int)</li>
<li>Constitution (int)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If all user input is valid, then your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Character: &lt;NAME&gt;, level &lt;LEVEL&gt; &lt;ANCESTRY&gt; &lt;CLASS&gt;</code></li>

<li><code>Ability Scores:</code></li>
<li><code>Str &lt;STRENGTH SCORE&gt; &lt;STRENGTH MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Dex &lt;DEXTERITY SCORE&gt; &lt;DEXTERITY MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Con &lt;CONSTITUTION SCORE&gt; &lt;CONSTITUTION MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Attacks:</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK1 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK1 MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK2 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK2 MODIFIER&gt;</code> (note: some characters only have one
attack)</li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a score (strength, dexterity, and constitution) is a single-digit number,
then it must be padded with an extra space so that all scores are
right-aligned in their column.</li>
<li>Each modifier (strength, dexterity, constitution, and attack) must be
preceded by a plus or minus sign. Negative modifiers have a minus sign, and
nonnegative (which includes zero) modifiers have a plus sign. This reinforces
how these numbers are meant to be used: they are usually added to dice rolls
and other values rather than used on their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability scores and attacks should also be indented (as shown in the example
below), but this will not be checked by the tests.</p>
<p>Here is an example of possible user input and the resulting character sheet:</p>
<p>Input:</p>

    Longbow +5
</code></pre>
<h3 id="valid-input"><a class="header" href="#valid-input">Valid Input</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways for the user to enter invalid input:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user can enter a string or double when you were expecting an integer. If
the user entered the word &quot;nine&quot; or the number 12.4 when asked for their
level, then this would be the wrong <em>type</em> of input.</li>
<li>The user can enter the correct <em>type</em> of input, but not one of the values
they were allowed to enter. If the user entered -2 or 50 when asked for
their level, then this would be the correct type of input (an integer), but
not one of the integers they were allowed to choose for their level (a
number from 1 to 20).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first kind of error is more complicated to deal with, and you probably
won't learn how to handle those errors until later in the semester. You only
need to worry about the second kind of error in this assignment. You can assume
that the user will always enter the correct type of value, but your code must
check whether it was one of the values they were allowed to choose. If the user
enters any invalid input, then your program must print the message <code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code> and exit.</p>
<p>Here are all of the rules you must enforce when checking the user's input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The level must be an integer from 1 to 20.</li>
<li>Each ability score must be an integer from 8 to 15.</li>
<li>The ancestry must be either &quot;human&quot;, &quot;elf&quot;, or &quot;dwarf&quot;.</li>
<li>The class must be either &quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;ranger&quot;, or &quot;rogue&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assume that the user's input for class and ancestry are always
lowercase. Your code <em>must</em> correctly handle the lowercase versions of these
strings, but it doesn't matter what you do when given other capitalizations
(such as &quot;Human&quot;, &quot;RANGER&quot;, or &quot;DwARf&quot;). You can treat those as invalid and
just print an error message (easiest to code but less user-friendly), or you
can make your code case-insensitive so that the capitalization does not matter
(harder to code but more user-friendly). However you decide to handle the
input, the ancestry and class <strong>must</strong> appear as all lowercase in the program's
output.</p>
<h3 id="calculations"><a class="header" href="#calculations">Calculations</a></h3>
<p>This program involves more calculations and variables than the previous
program. This section will serve as a reference for all values that are
calculated by the program.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before any other calculations, some of the ability <strong>scores</strong> must be
adjusted by the player's ancestry:
<ul>
<li>If the character is a human, increase each ability score by one.</li>
<li>If the character is an elf, increase their dexterity score by two.</li>
<li>If the character is a dwarf, increase their constitution score by two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each ability score has an associated number called its <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores">modifier</a>. The modifier <em>does not alter
the score</em>, it is derived <em>from</em> the score. The srd link has a table showing
the modifier associated with each score from 1 to 30, but we can calculate
the modifier with a formula.
<ul>
<li>Each ability modifier is calculated by dividing the score by 2 and
subtracting 5. The formula should look like this: <code>modifier = score / 2 - 5</code>.</li>
<li>It's important that you divide <em>before</em> subtracting because integer
division will round towards zero, not down. We could perform a similar
calculation by subtracting 10 and then dividing by 2, but this would give
the wrong value for odd ability scores below 10. For example, a score of
9 would produce a modifier of 0 when it should have a modifier of -1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character's HP equals their level multiplied by the sum of their
constitution modifier and their &quot;hit die&quot;. The hit die is determined by the
character's class. A fighter has a hit die of 10, and the other two classes
have a hit die of 8. The formula should look like this: <code>hp = level * (conModifier + hitDie)</code>.</li>
<li>The character's AC (armor class) uses a different formula depending on their

<h3 id="task-1-redesign-game"><a class="header" href="#task-1-redesign-game">Task 1: Redesign Game</a></h3>
<p>So far we've been using a simplified version of the D&amp;D 5e rules. Now it's time
to modify these rules to either bring them closer to the real D&amp;D rules or
change them to something you find more interesting. You're free to change them
however you want as long as you stick to the constraints listed below. You'll
also need to document your new rules in the write-up later.</p>
<p>You have a lot of freedom with how you design these new rules. If you want to
do something that doesn't fit with the constraints, then you can always ask me
first. The constraints are there to ensure you aren't oversimplifying the
rules, and I'm happy to allow exceptions as long as you get them approved ahead
of time. Try to have fun and embrace your creativity with this assignment. You
could make rules for a Transformers RPG, a dentistry management simulator, or a
game about cats that knock things off shelves.</p>
<h4 id="redesign-constraints"><a class="header" href="#redesign-constraints">Redesign Constraints</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>You need to include at least four <strong>primary stats</strong> (example: <strong>ability
scores</strong>) that the user can enter or generate using the system you create in
<a href="project1/part3.html#task-2-stat-generation">Task 2</a>. These stats, or numbers derived from them
(example: <strong>ability modifiers</strong>), should be used in most of your
calculations. If you stick with D&amp;D, then you must include <strong>all six ability
scores</strong> as primary stats and use their modifiers in calculations.</li>
<li>You need to include at least two kinds of traits (example: <strong>class</strong> and
<strong>ancestry</strong>). The user should be able to pick from several options for each
trait, and the traits should have an effect on some of your program's other
calculations. If you stick with D&amp;D, then you need to choose at least three
options for class and ancestry that weren't used in the previous versions of
this assignment. You should try to make these function similarly to how they
are described in the D&amp;D rules.</li>
<li>You need properties other than your primary stats. Most of these should be
calculated by your code (example: <strong>hp</strong> and <strong>ac</strong>) and not directly entered
by the user (example: <strong>level</strong>).</li>
<li>You need to include multiple &quot;layers&quot; of calculations. In the D&amp;D rules our
ability scores determined ability modifiers, and the ability modifiers
determined other stats (like hp, ac, and attack bonuses).</li>
</ul>
<p>You're free to include other input and choices for the user to make, but don't
make it too complicated. You can always start off with a simple design and then
build up to something more complex. Add one new feature at a time and make sure
the program still works before moving on to the next.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-stat-generation"><a class="header" href="#task-2-stat-generation">Task 2: Stat Generation</a></h3>
<p>D&amp;D has two commonly-used methods for determining your character's ability
scores: dice and point buy. You will implement similar methods to determine the
character's primary stats in your game.</p>
<h4 id="dice-method"><a class="header" href="#dice-method">Dice Method</a></h4>
<p>In early editions of D&amp;D you would roll three six-sided dice and sum the result
to determine each ability score. If you rolled a 3, 6, and 2 for your strength,
then your strength score would be 11. Then you might roll a 4, 6, and 6 and end
up with a 16 for your dexterity.</p>
<p>This method does not produce very good characters, and it doesn't give the
player a lot of choice over the type of character they play. More recent
editions of D&amp;D have you roll four dice, ignore the lowest number, and add the
other three together. You roll six scores, and then you can assign each score
to one of your abilities. The &quot;4d6 and drop the lowest&quot; method gives higher
numbers for better characters, and assigning the scores in any order lets the
player choose what kind of character to build.</p>
<h4 id="point-buy-method"><a class="header" href="#point-buy-method">Point Buy Method</a></h4>
<p>D&amp;D 5e also has a point buy system. With point buy, each ability score can be
any number from 8 to 15, but these numbers have a point cost (shown in <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/character-creation-outline/">the
Ability Score Cost table</a> in
the SRD). You're only allowed to spend 27 points on your ability scores.
Ancestry adjustments are applied after you choose these numbers and do not
affect the point costs.</p>
<p>There are other variations in Pathfinder and earlier editions of D&amp;D, but this
is the system in 5e.</p>
<h4 id="your-program"><a class="header" href="#your-program">Your Program</a></h4>
<p>You need to implement two different methods for choosing a character's stats: a
random method (such as simulated dice rolls) and a nonrandom method (such as
point buy). The user should choose which method to use each time they create a
character.</p>
<p>The random method can be simple, like the original D&amp;D method of rolling 3d6
for each ability in order. It can also be more complex, like the modern method
of rolling 4d6, dropping the lowest value, and assigning the scores in any
order. The nonrandom method can also be as simple or complex as you want to
make it. You could ask for the scores in order, check the total point cost, and
exit with an error if the user didn't stay within the budget. You could also
handle invalid choices without exiting early and allow the user to change
previous choices until they're finished.</p>
<p>The same advice about simplicity applies here. It's easy to make this part of
the program too complicated, so start with a method that's easy to code and
then revise it later <em>if you want to</em>. This part is only as challenging as you
want to make it, and there's no impact on your grade if you stick with an
easier method that isn't as user-friendly. Go for something more challenging if
you're enjoying the program and want to make a better version or solve a more
difficult problem.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-loop"><a class="header" href="#task-3-loop">Task 3: Loop</a></h3>
<p>Dependeng on how you implemented your stat generation systems, you may have
already completed this task. I want you to use at least one loop in your
program. Ideally, this should be in a way that improves the code or enables you
to do something that you couldn't do without the loop.</p>
<p>If you don't want to use a loop for part of the stat generation, then I will
suggest one alternative: use a loop for more user-friendly error handling.
Rather than exiting the program with an error message upon receiving invalid
input, you can continue asking the user until they enter valid input. This
would not allow you to handle input that causes a runtime error (such as the
user typing &quot;a&quot; when you're attempting to read an integer), but it can handle
input that isn't allowed by your character creation rules (such as a level
above 20 in the D&amp;D 5e rules).</p>
<p>Here's a rough outline of this error-handling loop:</p>
<pre><code>ask user for input
read input
while input isn't valid
    tell user input wasn't valid and ask them to retry
    read input
</code></pre>
<p>You can find a more detailed example in the notes.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>After completing the program, answer the questions below in a separate
document. <strong>This is not an essay: do NOT double-space, and keep your answers to
each question separate</strong>. Your answers should be reasonably detailed and
address each question in full. I expect you to be accurate when describing your
project, but I'm otherwise not concerned with whether you provide the &quot;correct&quot;
answer to a question. Much of what I'm asking you for is your opinion or
analysis of your work. I want to know what <em>you</em> think so that I can assess
your understanding and provide useful feedback. If I disagree with you, then I
will explain why and offer suggestions without penalizing your grade.</p>
<p>Also, an important reminder: <strong>do not use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with
or complete the write-up for you</strong>. The whole point is for you to think
critically about and explain your code. I do not care what ChatGPT &quot;thinks&quot;
about your work. Form your own opinions and justify them as best you can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain your redesign of the game:
<ul>
<li>Summarize your new design and explain why you went with this design.</li>
<li>What are your primary stats? What do these stats tell us about the
character? What range of numbers can a character normally have for these
stats?</li>
<li>What traits can a character have? What options can the user choose from
for each trait? What do these traits tell us about the character?</li>
<li>What other properties does a character have? What does each property tell
us about the character? How is each property calculated?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explain how the user generates their stats:
<ul>
<li>How does the randomized method work? Is it simulating something that you
could easily do by hand, such as rolling dice?</li>
<li>How does the nonrandom method work? What range of numbers can the user
choose, and what constraints did you give them?</li>
<li>Did you include any features to make your program easier to use or give
the player more control over their stats? If so, what are these features?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explain how you used a loop in your program. Was the loop necessary to write
that part of the program, or could you have written that part without a
loop? If you used multiple loops, then you can choose just one to talk
about. Include the relevant code in your answer and note the line number(s)
where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion).
Explain why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend
more time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>

<h2 id="background-1"><a class="header" href="#background-1">Background</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a> is a dice game played with
five six-sided dice. The game has thirteen rounds, and in each round a player

choose to only reroll some of their dice, leaving the others the same. Once a
player is finished rolling their dice, they choose one of the thirteen scoring
categories and receive points based on their dice. Each category can only be
selected once.</p>

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are required to use the methods in <code>Dice.java</code> to generate all random
numbers your program uses. This is necessary for your code to be compatible
with some of my tests. You can call any of the methods in <code>Dice.java</code> from
your <code>DiceGame.java</code> program by writing <code>Dice.methodName(args)</code>.</li>
<li><code>Dice</code> contains a <code>roll</code> method that allows you to simulate a die with any
number of sides. You can call <code>Dice.roll(6)</code> in your code to simulate a
six-sided die. <code>Dice</code> also contains methods for all of the standard
polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20). This means you could also
use <code>Dice.d6()</code> to simulate a six-sided die. It doesn't matter whether you
use the <code>roll</code> method or one of the polyhedral dice methods.</li>
<li>This Java programs, like most of the other Java programs you will write, is
broken up into multiple methods and multiple classes. There are two ways we
will take advantage of this to make our dice game easier to code:
<ul>
<li>When writing a method that performs a complex task, we can simplify our
code by breaking the task into smaller sub-tasks and making each sub-task
its own method. We can even use these methods before we've finished
writing them to test the code for our complex task.</li>
<li>When writing a method that performs a smaller task, we can code that
method without thinking about the rest of the program as long as we've
clearly defined that methods inputs, outputs, and expected behavior. It's
much easier to think about a small task on its own than it is to think
about the entire program at once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, this project set is meant to get you used to writing methods. My
directions will often describe methods and ask you to write them based on
that description. I will give you the code for a few of these methods, but
you should always try to write them yourself before looking at or using the
provided code. This will help you learn what these method descriptions mean
so that you're ready to write them yourself when I stop showing you what the
code looks like.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Start by creating your <code>DiceGame</code> class and giving it the standard <code>main</code>
method. The code below shows what this should look like:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * TODO: put your name here as the author and provide a *short* description of
 * your DiceGame program.
 */
public class DiceGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Most of our code is going to go in a separate <code>game</code> method instead of in
the <code>main</code> method. It's not necessary to structure a program like this, but
it gets you used to passing a <code>Scanner</code> to different parts of your program
and makes the program a little easier for me to test. Make the following
changes to your program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import <code>java.util.Scanner</code> before you declare your <code>DiceGame</code> class.</li>
<li>Add a <code>public</code> <code>static</code> method named <code>game</code> after your main method. Give
<code>game</code> a return type of <code>void</code> and a single parameter with the type
<code>Scanner</code>.</li>
<li>In your main method, create a new Scanner that reads from <code>System.in</code>,
call <code>game</code> and pass your new scanner as the only argument, and finally
close the scanner at the end of your main method. The last step isn't
strictly necessary, but it's a good habit to close resources such as
scanners when you're done using them to avoid leaking memory.</li>
<li>In your game method, print &quot;Hello World&quot; or some other
message so you can see that the program is working when
you test it. You can delete this print statement once you
know your program works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compile and run your program after you finish making the above changes. Make
sure it compiles without errors and prints the message you put in your game
method. If you can't figure out how to make all of the above changes, here's
what your code should look like:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * TODO: put your name here as the author and provide a *short* description of
 * your DiceGame program.
 */
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DiceGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        game(input);

        input.close();

        System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>We're going to be working with arrays during this project. As you may have
already noticed, Java does not print arrays very nicely by default. While
it's not required for this program, we can add a temporary <code>printArray</code>
method to make testing easier. Try coding <code>printArray</code> based on the
following description:</p>
<ul>
<li>a public static method that doesn't return anything.</li>
<li>has one parameter: an array of integers</li>
<li>contains a for loop that iterates over its array parameter and prints
each element of that array</li>
<li>(optional but highly recommended) uses <code>print</code> instead of <code>println</code> to
keep everything on the same line</li>
<li>(optional but highly recommended) ends with a <code>println</code> to move to the
next line</li>
<li>(optional) includes some kind of header/label before the array so we know
what we're looking at in the output</li>
<li>(optional) further decorates the output with commas to make it look nice</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need help, here's how I would write <code>printArray</code>:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// public, static, returns nothing (void), array of ints as the only parameter (int[] a)
public static void printArray(int[] a) {
    // Print a label for the array and use print (not println) to stay on the same line
    System.out.print(&quot;Array: {&quot;);

    // Iterate over the array
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; ++i) {

        // Not important, but I want to include commas and not have an extra trailing or
        // leading comma. It looks a little nicer this way!
        if (i &gt; 0) {
            System.out.print(&quot;,&quot;);
        }

        // Print the array element with a space before it
        System.out.print(&quot; &quot; + a[i]);
    }

    // Close the curly brackets and move to the next line
    System.out.println(&quot; }&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Now we can write the <code>game</code> method. Much of our program will be handled by
three other methods, but we can write <code>game</code> first and test it with stubs
(placeholder versions) of the other methods. The game method involves
several steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an array of five dice (integers).</li>
<li>Roll all of the dice in that array. We'll skip this for now because we
haven't written the method that will roll the dice for us. You should
print a placeholder message so you can see when the program reaches this
step.</li>
<li>Print the dice so the user can see their initial values. For now we can
do this with <code>printArray</code>, but later we'll use a different method to
convert the dice into a string.</li>
<li>Ask the user whether they want to reroll some dice. At this point you
should be very familiar with how to prompt for and read user input.</li>
<li>If the user answers &quot;yes&quot;, then we need to ask them which dice to reroll,
reroll those dice, and print the dice again so they can see the new
values. We can skip rerolling the dice for now (another placeholder
message would be a good idea here), but we can easily prompt for input
and print the dice again. The dice won't change since we aren't rerolling
anything, but we still want the output so we can check whether our code
is performing each step when we want it to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delete the old hello world print statement and try coding this method. When

when you answer &quot;yes&quot; and when you answer &quot;no&quot; to the reroll prompt. You

<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Let's create stubs for our dice rolling methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>These methods must be named <code>rollAllDice</code> and <code>rollSomeDice</code>.</li>
<li>Both are public static methods that don't return anything.</li>
<li>Both methods have a parameter for the dice (an array of integers).</li>
<li>The <code>rollSomeDice</code> method has a second parameter: a string that contains
the &quot;label&quot; (index) of each die it has to reroll.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put a print statement inside each method so we know when we've called the
method. It should print a short message, such as &quot;You called the rollAllDice
method.&quot;</p>
<p>Compile your program again to make sure there are no syntax errors before
you continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete the placeholder print statements in your <code>game</code> method and instead
call the appropriate roll method. You should already have the necessary
parameters: the dice array for <code>rollAllDice</code>, and the dice array plus the
second piece of user input for <code>rollSomeDice</code>.</p>
<p>Compile and run your program to make sure everything works. You should
expect to see the messages from your roll methods instead of the old
placeholder messages you just deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now it's time to implement the <code>rollAllDice</code> method (remember to delete the
placeholder print statement!). This method should iterate over its parameter
(the dice array) and set each element equal to a random number from 1 to 6.
You already have two methods you can call from the <code>Dice</code> class to generate
these numbers, so choose whichever one you prefer. You also have an example
of a loop that iterates over an array in the <code>printArray</code> method.</p>
<p>Once you write this method, compile and run your program to see whether it
works. If it's working, then you should only see numbers from 1 to 6 instead
of zeroes whenever you print the array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>rollSomeDice</code> method is similar to the previous method, but we need to
reroll the dice listed in our string parameter and skip the rest of the
dice. We will assume that the string parameter is a string containing some
set of the digits 0 to 4. These represent all of the valid indexes in our
dice array. We will only reroll a die if its index appears in that string.</p>
<p>You can start by copying the code inside your <code>rollAllDice</code> method. Add an
if statement to check whether the current <strong>index</strong> (not the die value)
appears in the string parameter. You can ask a string whether it contains
another string using the <code>contains</code> method. You'll need to convert your
index to a String before calling <code>contains</code>. The method call will look
something like this (depending on your variable/parameter names):
<code>str.contains(&quot;&quot; + index)</code>.</p>
<p>Once you finish this method, go ahead and test your program again! If you
enter some numbers from 0 to 4 when asked which dice to reroll, then you
should see some of the dice values change when they're printed for the
second time. For example, responding with &quot;012&quot; should cause the program to
reroll the first three dice in the array. Remember that these rerolls are
random, so there's a chance that some of the rerolled dice will end up with
the same value as before. However, most of the dice you tell your program to
reroll should change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final step is to write a <code>diceString</code> method that will convert your dice
array to a nice-looking string. We'll show the user the labels for the dice
so they know how to specify which dice to reroll, and we'll make the output
look more like a row of dice instead of five plain numbers.</p>
<p>Start by declaring the <code>diceString</code> method: it's a public static method that
returns a <code>String</code> and takes an array of integers as its only parameter.
Keep the return type in mind: we're not printing anything inside this method
body. Instead, we're building a <code>String</code> and returning that string. The code
that calls this method will be responsible for printing the resulting
string. </p>
<p>You can check the <a href="project2/part1.html#additional-details">Additional Details</a> section to see
the exact format this string must take. You can use hard-coded strings for
the labels and the top/bottom edges of the dice, but you should use a loop
to generate the middle of the dice. You can build the middle section by
concatenating each element from the dice array with the pipe character and
some spaces.</p>
<p>One last thing to remember is to add line breaks (<code>&quot;\n&quot;</code>) between the label
row, the top/bottom edges, and the middle section. This won't look very good
if everything is on the same line.</p>
<p>After you finish this method, you should be able to replace your calls to
<code>printArray</code> with <code>System.out.println(diceString(dice))</code>. As always, run
your program and make sure everything works as expected.</p>

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We'll start with a small change to our previous code. Let's replace the old
0-4 labels with letters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify the <code>diceString</code> method to use the labels A, B, C, D, and E
instead of 0-4.</li>
<li>Modify the <code>rollSomeDice</code> method to look for the letter corresponding to
each index rather than the index itself. You can convert an index to a
letter by adding it to <code>'a'</code> and converting the result to a <code>char</code>:
<code>(char)('a' + index)</code>. You can then convert this character to a <code>String</code>
and use it with the <code>contains</code> method like you did in part 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, test your program before you continue. Make sure the correct
labels are displayed and your program rerolls the proper dice when you enter
letters instead of numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're going to split our <code>game</code> method into two main parts: the reroll phase
and the score phase. Most of our current code will move to a method for the
reroll phase, and your program should still work the same as before the
split. Check that everything is working when you test it.</p>
<p>To split up the <code>game</code> method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a <code>rerollPhase</code> and a <code>scorePhase</code> method. Each of these methods
should return nothing and take two parameters: a <code>Scanner</code> and an array
of integers (our dice).</li>
<li>Move most of the code that's currently in <code>game</code> into <code>rerollPhase</code>.
Leave the lines that create the dice array and roll all of the dice in
your <code>game</code> method.</li>
<li>Call <code>rerollPhase</code> and <code>scorePhase</code> in your <code>game</code> method. The score
phase won't do anything for now, but you could add a placeholder print
statement just to show that it's getting called. Your <code>game</code> method
should look something like this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void game(Scanner input) {
    int[] dice = new int[5];

    rollAllDice(dice);

    rerollPhase(input, dice);

    scorePhase(input, dice);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Next, we will use a loop to allow the user to reroll their dice more than
once. You could also accomplish this by duplicating a lot of code, but the
loop will be shorter, cleaner, and easier to read.</p>
<p>We want to repeat the reroll process for as long as the user has rerolls
left. Make a variable to hold the number of rerolls (it should start at 2),
then create a while loop that repeats for as long as the user has more than
zero rerolls. Move the rest of your reroll phase code into this loop.</p>
<p>If the user answers &quot;yes&quot; when asked if they want to reroll their dice, then
you should decrease the number of rerolls by one. If the user does not
answer &quot;yes&quot;, then you can set the number of rerolls to zero so we don't
keep asking them to reroll their dice.</p>
<p>Finally, we can move our code that prints the user's rerolled dice out of
the loop. We're already printing the dice at the beginning of the loop, so
the user will see what changed between rerolls. We only need to print them
once after the loop so they can see the final set of dice before scoring.</p>
<p>Test your code and make sure you can reroll twice (but no more) if you
always answer &quot;yes&quot; when asked whether to reroll dice. Make sure that
answering &quot;no&quot; causes the program to print the dice once more before ending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're going to make one other change to the reroll phase so that our program
is easier to use. Currently, we have to enter two separate messages: one to
say that we want to reroll and another to say which dice we want to reroll.
As the user, it would be nice to include the dice labels when we tell the
program to reroll our dice.</p>
<p>Modify your loop so that it asks the user for a command instead of asking
whether they want to reroll. You should accept two different commands: &quot;roll
&quot; followed by some dice labels, and &quot;skip&quot;. The roll command should reroll
the dice and decrease the reroll count by one, the skip command should set
the reroll count to zero, and any other command should result in an error
message (see the <a href="project2/part2.html#io-format">I/O Format section</a>).</p>
<p>The roll command might be a little tricky to handle. However, it's much
easier once you know the right string methods (check the notes and/or Java
API for more information about these methods):</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use <code>startsWith</code> instead of <code>equals</code> to check whether the command
begins with the word &quot;roll&quot;.</li>
<li>You can get a string containing only the labels (without the word &quot;roll&quot;)
by taking a <code>substring</code> of the command. You'll need to provide the
starting index for the substring.</li>
<li>You can get the first index where a character appears in a string with
the <code>indexOf</code> method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to add a few other methods for use in the score phase:
<code>scoreString</code>, <code>calculateDiceScore</code>, and <code>countDice</code>. For now, we're just
going to write stubs (placeholders) for these methods. This will let us call
them in the score phase code before we finish writing them, much like when
we wrote the <code>game</code> method in part 1.</p>
<p>To create a stub, we just need the method signature line and, if it returns
a value, a temporary return statement in the method body. This is enough for
us to compile code that calls the method, even if the method doesn't yet do
anything useful. Write a stub for the methods listed above. Check the
<a href="project2/part2.html#functions">Functions section</a> for details like the parameters and return
type of each method. When you add the temporary return statement to these
methods, just return <code>&quot;placeholder&quot;</code> or <code>-1</code> (depending on whether the
return type is <code>String</code> or <code>int</code>). We want something that we'll easily
recognize in our output so we know that our score phase code called these
methods and used their return values.</p>
<p>As usual, compile your code and make sure it still works before you
continue!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With placeholders for our other methods, we can now write the <code>scorePhase</code>
method. We'll start with a simplified version that assumes valid input:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call <code>scoreString</code> and print the string it returns</li>
<li>Prompt the user to choose which die value they want to score</li>
<li>Subtract one from the user's input</li>
<li>Call <code>calculateDiceScore</code> with the user's chosen die value and print the
result</li>
</ul>
<p>Test your code and make sure everything still works. You should now see the
output from <code>scorePhase</code>, including the placeholder values returned by some
of the method stubs you wrote earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a loop to the prompt in <code>scorePhase</code>. If the user enters an invalid
number (valid numbers are integers from 1 to 6), then you should print an
error message and continue reading input until the user enters a valid
number.</p>
<p>Test your code and make sure it handles invalid numbers correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the <code>calculateDiceScore</code> method. You can use the <code>countDice</code> method to
count how many times the die value occurs in the dice array, then return
that number multiplied by the die value.</p>
<p>Remember that your second parameter is the <strong>category index</strong>, not the <strong>die
value</strong>. The die value will be one greater than the category index. This may
seem like an odd choice if you follow the user input from <code>scorePhase</code>
(where we subtracted one) to this method (where we added one). It will make
more sense in project 2.3 when we add the other score categories.</p>
<p>As always, test your code! We know that our <code>countDice</code> stub currently
returns -1, so we should now expect the return value to be whatever die
value we enter multiplied by -1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the <code>countDice</code> method. This method should iterate over the dice array
and count how many times the given die value appears in the array. When you
test your code, you should now see the correct score for the chosen upper
category. For example, if the user chose to score 3 with the dice 1, 6, 3,
4, and 3, then they should receive 6 points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final method we need to write is <code>scoreString</code>. To start, I recommend
creating the following array at the beginning of <code>scoreString</code>: <code>String[] categoryNames = new String[] {&quot;Aces&quot;, &quot;Twos&quot;, &quot;Threes&quot;, &quot;Fours&quot;, &quot;Fives&quot;, &quot;Sixes&quot;};</code>. This will give you an array with all of the category names and
make it much easier to use a loop in this method.</p>
<p>Now we need to build a string. Remember, we're <strong>not</strong> supposed to print
anything! We need to create and return a string, then let the code that
called this method decide what to do with it. Start with the header shown
in the <a href="project2/part2.html#io-format">I/O Format section</a>: <code>&quot;Score Options:\n&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can create a loop that iterates over each category index. This
loop should add a line for that category that looks like this: <code>    1. Aces: 3</code>. We start with four spaces of indentation, then the number the
user would enter to choose this category, then the category name (from the
array we created earlier), and finally the score we would receive for that
category (use the <code>calculateDiceScore</code> method).</p>
<p>With this method complete, your program should be finished! Test it to make
sure everything works. The tests won't give useful feedback if you code
can't compile.</p>

<h3 id="task-1-determine-your-rules"><a class="header" href="#task-1-determine-your-rules">Task 1: Determine Your Rules</a></h3>
<p>You have two options for this project. You can either implement most of the
standard Yahtzee rules, or you can make up your own rules and modify the game.</p>
<h4 id="option-1-standard-yahtzee-rules"><a class="header" href="#option-1-standard-yahtzee-rules">Option 1: Standard Yahtzee Rules</a></h4>
<p>If you choose this option, then you must complete the program by implementing
the remaining parts of Yahtzee. Your program must follow all of the standard
rules except for the &quot;Yahtzee Bonus&quot; rules in the official rules. In your
program, a Yahtzee should be treated like any other scoring category with no
special cases.</p>
<p>This option also requires your program to pass a set of tests, just like a
guided project. The <a href="project2/part3.html#additional-details">additional details</a> section has a
list of I/O requirements and function requirements that will be checked by the
tests. The structure provided by these requirements may also be helpful if
you're having trouble writing this program without the usual guided coding
steps.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-custom-dice-game-rules"><a class="header" href="#option-2-custom-dice-game-rules">Option 2: Custom Dice Game Rules</a></h4>
<p>If you are going to change the rules, then you must send me a proposal with
your new ruleset. Explain your rules in enough detail that I or another person
could play your game with a set of physical dice using only the information in
your proposal.</p>
<p>This option exempts you from the tests for 2.3, but it requires an approved
proposal at least one week before you submit the project. If you don't meet
this requirement, then your project will be reviewed as though you chose the
first option.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-implement-your-game"><a class="header" href="#task-2-implement-your-game">Task 2: Implement Your Game</a></h3>
<p>If you are implementing standard Yahtzee rules, then refer to the <a href="project2/part3.html#additional-details">additional
details</a> section for specific requirements and the
<a href="https://instructions.hasbro.com/en-ca/instruction/yahtzee-classic">official
rules</a> for
the actual game rules. </p>
<p>If you are implementing your own custom game, then you should refer to your
proposal for specific requirements.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-write-up"><a class="header" href="#task-3-write-up">Task 3: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>After completing the program, answer the questions below in a separate
document. <strong>This is not an essay: do NOT double-space, and keep your answers to
each question separate</strong>. Your answers should be reasonably detailed and
address each question in full. I expect you to be accurate when describing your
project, but I'm otherwise not concerned with whether you provide the &quot;correct&quot;
answer to a question. Much of what I'm asking you for is your opinion or
analysis of your work. I want to know what <em>you</em> think so that I can assess
your understanding and provide useful feedback. If I disagree with you, then I
will explain why and offer suggestions without penalizing your grade.</p>
<p>Also, an important reminder: <strong>do not use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with
or complete the write-up for you</strong>. The whole point is for you to think
critically about and explain your code. I do not care what ChatGPT &quot;thinks&quot;
about your work. Form your own opinions and justify them as best you can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion).
Explain why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend
more time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<p>The questions I would normally ask about your redesign of the game will be
covered by your proposal, so these are the only two write-up questions.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables-5"><a class="header" href="#deliverables-5">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>All Java code you wrote for this assignment</li>

<h2 id="additional-details-standard-yahtzee-rules-only"><a class="header" href="#additional-details-standard-yahtzee-rules-only">Additional Details (Standard Yahtzee Rules Only)</a></h2>
<p>This section covers the requirements for anyone who chose to implement the
standard Yahtzee rules. If you went with the custom rules option, then you can
ignore this part of the assignment.</p>
<p>One quick note about category numbers: you may notice that the user's input and
the output we display to the user always labels the score categories from one
to thirteen, but in our code we use the numbers zero to twelve. The numbers one
to thirteen will feel more natural to the average user, but these numbers are
all off by one if we need to index an array. Remember to subtract one when
going from user input to an array index and add one when going from an array
index to output displayed to the user.</p>
<h3 id="io-format-4"><a class="header" href="#io-format-4">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>The I/O requirements work just like a guided project, and they will be
evaluated by the same test program.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>During each iteration of the reroll phase:
<ul>
<li>The command &quot;roll X&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is a series of letters (uppercase or
lowercase) from A to E</li>
<li>The command &quot;skip&quot;</li>
<li>(optional) In addition to &quot;roll X&quot; and &quot;skip&quot;, you can accept
abbreviations such as &quot;r X&quot; and &quot;s&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During the score phase:
<ul>
<li>An integer</li>
<li>If the integer is not a valid choice, then read additional integers until
a valid choice is entered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of each round:
<ul>
<li>The round number, formatted as &quot;Round X&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During each iteration of the reroll phase:
<ul>
<li>The user's dice, formatted by the <code>diceString</code> method</li>
<li>The number of rolls remaining formatted as &quot;X rolls remaining.&quot;</li>
<li>If the user enters an invalid command, the message &quot;ERROR: INVALID
COMMAND&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the end of the reroll phase:
<ul>
<li>The user's dice, formatted by the <code>diceString</code> method</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During the score phase:
<ul>
<li>The output of the <code>scoreString</code> function</li>
<li>The message &quot;ERROR: INVALID CATEGORY&quot; for each input the user provides
that isn't a number from 1 to 13</li>
<li>The message &quot;ERROR: CATEGORY UNAVAILABLE&quot; for each input the user
provides that corresponds to a category that was already taken</li>
<li>The number of points received for the chosen category and that category's
name formatted as &quot;You receive X points for Y.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the final round:
<ul>
<li>The line &quot;Final Score Card:&quot;</li>
<li>The output of the <code>scoreString</code> function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, your program should include reasonable prompts for information
and any additional text that you think would make it easier for the user to
interact with the program. It's up to you how much of this to include, what
exactly to say, and how to format it. The tests will not check these prompts.</p>
<h3 id="functions-1"><a class="header" href="#functions-1">Functions</a></h3>
<p>Your <code>DiceGame</code> class must include all of the methods (functions) described
below. Each of these methods must have the <code>public</code> and <code>static</code> modifiers.</p>

<p>The final project is a completely open-ended assignment. You will design a
program that you would like to build in Java, submit a proposal for approval,
and then create your program.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives-6"><a class="header" href="#learning-objectives-6">Learning Objectives</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Design and write a Java program from scratch</li>
<li>Research a new feature of the Java programming language</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tasks-6"><a class="header" href="#tasks-6">Tasks</a></h2>
<h3 id="task-1-design-and-research"><a class="header" href="#task-1-design-and-research">Task 1: Design and Research</a></h3>
<h4 id="pick-an-idea"><a class="header" href="#pick-an-idea">Pick an Idea</a></h4>
<p>The first thing you need to do is decide what kind of program you will create.
This can be <em>anything</em>, so choose something that you find interesting and will
either enjoy working on or enjoy using once it's complete.</p>
<p>Many students struggle to come up with ideas when starting this project. If
you're not sure what to do, then I recommend beginning with a list of your
hobbies and interests. Consider how programming can be combined with one of
those topics or what kind of program you might find useful when engaging with
that hobby/interest. <strong>Do not ask me to suggest a topic for you.</strong> I'm happy to
discuss ideas that you're considering or discuss how you might apply your
programming skills to a particular topic, but you need to come up with ideas
and choose one that's appealing to you.</p>
<p>This project is meant to challenge you, so I expect the proposed program to be
similar in scope and complexity to the program you created for projects 1.3 or
2.3. I will not approve your proposal if the program appears too small to be a
challenge, and I will be reluctant to approve any projects that I don't think
can reasonably be finished in 2-4 weeks.</p>
<h4 id="pick-a-research-topic"><a class="header" href="#pick-a-research-topic">Pick a Research Topic</a></h4>
<p>The second thing you need to do is find a topic to research that will help you
create this program. I want you to spend some time learning about a feature of
the Java programming language or a part of the standard library that we haven't
covered in class. You could also choose something we have covered in class, but
that you would like to learn more about.</p>
<p>You shouldn't choose an arbitrary topic. Consider what features you might want
to include in your program and what you might need to learn to implement those
features. Chances are, you'll find several potential research topics by doing
this.</p>
<p>You might also already have a topic that really interests you. If you're more
motivated to learn about multi-threading, for example, than you are to write a
particular program, then it's fine to start with a research topic that you
really like and make up an idea for a program that will let you learn about
your research topic.</p>
<h4 id="research"><a class="header" href="#research">Research</a></h4>
<p>I expect you to have researched your topic before you send me your proposal
(task 2). However, once you have your program idea and topic, you might want to
discuss them with me before you start on the research. I can't pre-approve your
proposal, but I can tell you whether I think the program and topic are
appropriate for CSC110 and reasonable in scope.</p>
<p>Research can include looking up tutorials, reading a textbook, reading the Java
documentation, or just experimenting on your own. All I want you to do is
choose a programming topic and learn about it on your own.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-proposal"><a class="header" href="#task-2-proposal">Task 2: Proposal</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a proposal describing your project. Your proposal should be
approved before you begin working on the program, and I will not accept any
program submissions unless the proposal for that program was approved at least
one week prior to the submission.</p>
<p>A final project proposal must include the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Summarize the program you intend to write. Tell me enough about the program
that I'll understand what it does and why I or another person might want to
use it.</li>
<li>Why is this project interesting to you and what made you want to work on it?
Does it relate to your hobbies or interests outside of programming?</li>
<li>Tell me about the topic you researched for this project and how you expect
to use it in your program.
<ul>
<li>What is the topic?</li>
<li>What did you know about the topic before starting this project?</li>
<li>What have you learned about the topic from your research?</li>
<li>How will it be used to write your program?</li>
<li>Include a short example program demonstrating how you expect to make use
of this topic in your project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>List all of your deliverables for this project. This means everything I
should expect you to send me when you submit the finished project. At a
minimum, this will include all of your source code and a writeup.</li>
<li>Describe the project's essential features in detail. You must clearly
explain each feature and what I should expect to see when I run the program.
You must include enough information for me or anyone reading the proposal to
determine whether you've implemented the features correctly in your finished
program. <em>I will use this section to determine whether your project is
complete, and I will not approve a proposal that doesn't include enough
information for me to evaluate your project.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I will aim to give feedback on all proposals within one week of their
submission. Remember that you may also need to revise your proposal before I
approve it, so you should submit the proposal at least a week before you plan
to start working on the program. If you wait until shortly before the project
deadline to submit a proposal, then you should not expect me to approve your
project in time for you to submit it and receive credit.</p>
<h4 id="proposal-revisions"><a class="header" href="#proposal-revisions">Proposal Revisions</a></h4>
<p>At any point before you submit the project, you're free to submit a revised
proposal. An open-ended project like this will rarely go the way you expected
when you began, and you may decide the initial idea isn't as interesting as you
thought it would be or think of a better idea after you get started. I will
review and either approve it or ask for changes just like your initial
proposal.</p>
<h4 id="proposal-deadline"><a class="header" href="#proposal-deadline">Proposal Deadline</a></h4>
<p>While I'm not giving you a fixed deadline for proposals, I have one restriction
on how late you can submit them: your approved proposal must be submitted at
least one week before you submit the project. This also applies to proposal
revisions: if I approve a revised proposal, then you cannot submit your project
until at least one week after you submitted the revised proposal.</p>
<p>Just in case my wording above is unclear, here's an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You submit a proposal April 2nd.</li>
<li>I review it April 6th and request changes.</li>
<li>You revise and resubmit the proposal April 10th.</li>
<li>I review it April 12th and approve it.</li>
<li>In this scenario, April 17th is one week after you submitted a proposal that
I approved. That's the earliest you would be allowed to submit the project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-3-program"><a class="header" href="#task-3-program">Task 3: Program</a></h3>
<p>If your proposal has been approved, then you can go ahead and write your
program. It must include the essential features described in your proposal and
make use of your research topic as described in your proposal.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up-1"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up-1">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a document (preferably a PDF) with your program that contains
the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instructions for using the program. These must be accurate and include
sufficient detail for someone unfamiliar with your program to use all of its
features. You do not need to explain how to compile it unless it involves
more than running <code>javac</code> on the source code (for example, if the user must
import a third-party library that your program uses).</li>
<li>A description of how your research topic was used in the program. Include
and explain at least one example from your project's source code.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion).
Explain why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend
more time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverables-6"><a class="header" href="#deliverables-6">Deliverables</a></h2>
<p>This is covered by your proposal.</p>
<h2 id="group-final-projects"><a class="header" href="#group-final-projects">Group Final Projects</a></h2>
<p>If you would like to work on this project with one or more other students, then
you can submit a group proposal. I will expect significantly more out of group
projects. Below is a list of changes to the project requirements.</p>
<h3 id="group-proposal"><a class="header" href="#group-proposal">Group Proposal</a></h3>
<p>If you are submitting a group proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each group member must choose their own different research topic (and
research it) before you write your proposal.</li>
<li>Each group member must write their own separate answers to questions two and
three. The group proposal must include each member's answers to these
questions.</li>
<li>Each essential feature for question five must designate one group member as
the person primarily responsible for implementing that feature. You aren't
committed to dividing up the work this way, but I want you to put some
thought into how the work will be divided before you begin the project.</li>
<li>Earlier in this assignment, I said &quot;I expect the proposed program to be
similar in scope and complexity to the program you created for projects 1.3
or 2.3.&quot; A group project should be somewhat greater in scope and complexity
than projects 1.3 and 2.3.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-work"><a class="header" href="#group-work">Group Work</a></h3>
<p>When you are working on the program, your group must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that each member contributes a similar amount of work to the other
members. It is not acceptable for one group member to contribute
significantly more work than the other members or for one group member to
contribute significantly less work than the other members.</li>
<li>Keep track of each individual member's significant contributions to the
project.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is a shared responsibility</strong>, and it requires regular communication
within your group. If you cannot communicate with your group members enough to
divide work evenly and keep track of individual contributions, then you cannot
work as a group on this project.</p>
<p>I also do not care whether you're the one leaving most of the work to the rest
of your group, the one doing twice as much work as everyone else, or a
bystander watching this imbalance take place. All of these are unacceptable. If
you decide to work as a group, then you are accepting some responsibility for
your group members. Don't work with people who you don't trust to be good group
members, and don't remain with a group if you feel the other members are not
meeting their obligations to the rest of the group.</p>
<h3 id="group-write-up"><a class="header" href="#group-write-up">Group Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a group write-up that covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question one (the instructions) from the original write-up</li>
<li>The record of individual contributions mentioned earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>Each group member must submit their own individual write-up that covers the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remaining questions from the original write-up</li>
<li>A summary of your contributions to the group</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-submission"><a class="header" href="#group-submission">Group Submission</a></h3>
<p>I only need one submission with the group write-up and all other deliverables
listed in your proposal. The individual write-ups can be submitted by each
group member separately or included with the group submission.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="modified-expanded-projects"><a class="header" href="#modified-expanded-projects">Modified Expanded Projects</a></h1>
<p>If you don't find one of the expanded projects very interesting and would
prefer to code something else, then I encourage you to propose an alternative
project. This is more work, but the extra effort can be worth it if you're
spending your time on something that you enjoy more than the default project.
This page describes how all of the requirements for a modified/alternative
expanded project. You can also use this to propose an alternative to guided
projects.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives-7"><a class="header" href="#learning-objectives-7">Learning Objectives</a></h2>
<p>Pay attention to the learning objectives in the project you are
modifying/replacing. Some of these will be covered by the fact that you are
designing and proposing your own project, but you should still check to make
sure your proposal addresses each learning objective. I'm not likely to approve
a proposal that doesn't cover the same objectives as the assignment it's
replacing.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Your proposal must summarize your project. You don't need to get into detail
here; I just want on overview of the program you plan to write so that I know
what to expect. I recommend sending me this summary before you go any further
with the proposal. If I have concerns about an idea or don't think it will
work, then I'd rather tell you this before you time writing the rest of the
proposal.</p>
<h2 id="tasks-7"><a class="header" href="#tasks-7">Tasks</a></h2>
<p>Explain each task you will complete. This is where you should go into detail. I
expect something comparable to the task explanations in my assignments. When I
write directions for a task, I'm trying to make it clear what I expect you to
do and provide a little guidance. There are three reasons I need some detail
here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to determine whether this meets the learning objectives for the
project it will replace.</li>
<li>I need to determine whether your project is an appropriate scope and
difficulty. I don't want you to take on something that will be too large or
challenging to finish, and I don't want you using the alternate projects to
trivialize assignments that are meant to help you improve as a programmer.</li>
<li>I need to determine whether the work you turned in is complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="write-up"><a class="header" href="#write-up">Write-Up</a></h2>
<p>You must still complete a write-up for your project, but it will only include
the two standard questions I put on every open-ended project write-up. You've
already done a fair amount of writing in creating your proposal, so that is an
appropriate substitute for the assignment-specific questions.</p>
<p>The write-up for your modified assignment must address the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion).
Explain why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend
more time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<p>I otherwise have the same expectations for this write-up as any other project
write-up. Address each question in full and don't use an &quot;AI&quot; program to assist
you.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables-7"><a class="header" href="#deliverables-7">Deliverables</a></h2>
<p>Your proposal should state any deliverables aside from the write-up. This will
probably just be your program, but depending on the project you may decide to
include other deliverables, such as test data or a README.</p>
<p>In order for an open-ended project to be considered complete, it must</p>
<ul>
<li>be submitted on Blackboard before the final deadline</li>
<li>compile and run without syntax errors</li>
<li>demonstrate that you have completed each task as directed</li>
<li>include a document that fully addresses each of the write-up questions</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ignore write-up questions, tasks, or the directions within a task, then
the project is incomplete. You can still resubmit an incomplete project, but
resubmitting after the deadline will incur a significant late penalty.</p>
<h2 id="deadline"><a class="header" href="#deadline">Deadline</a></h2>
<p>If you are replacing an expanded project, then your project is still due on the
same day as the project it replaced. If you think you'll need extra time, then
read the deadline/extension policy in the syllabus.</p>
<p>If you are replacing one or more guided projects, then we'll need to discuss an
appropriate deadline. I allow guided projects to be turned in up until the last
week of classes because they don't take time for me to review. However,
reviewing open-ended assignments is much more time consuming, and I need to
make sure these don't all pile up at the end of the semester. By default, I'll
want to use the same deadline as whatever expanded project normally follows the
guided projects you are replacing.</p>
<p>Finally, whatever deadline you have for the modified project, you need to get
the project approved at least one week before that deadline. I don't want to
allow or encourage alternative projects as last-minute attempts to get around
project requirements. This is something you need to start thinking about early
and tell me about well before the assignment itself is due.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-revisions-1"><a class="header" href="#proposal-revisions-1">Proposal Revisions</a></h2>
<p>You can revise your proposal up to a week before the deadline. Once we're down
to a week, you're committed to the most recent version of your proposal that I
approved. A revision would be appropriate if you underestimated the difficulty
of a task or thought of a better idea for part of the project.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="testing"><a class="header" href="#testing">Testing</a></h1>
<p>All Guided Projects are checked by the same test program. This chapter covers
how to use the test program and how to interpret the test results.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-program"><a class="header" href="#the-program">The Program</a></h1>
<p>This section explains what the program is and includes some details that you
don't need in order to use it. This information is here in case you're curious
about how the program works, and it may help you troubleshoot any problems that
come up when using it.</p>
<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>The test program is written in Java and launched by a shell script called
<code>test.sh</code>. This script runs <code>tests/bin/projecttests/Main</code> and passes along any
arguments you provide (everything you type after <code>sh tests/test.sh</code>).</p>
<p>I've only tested this program on bash terminals. It should work fine on <code>bash</code>,
<code>zsh</code>, or a <code>bash</code> emulator running on Windows. You might be able to run it
from <code>cmd</code> or <code>powershell</code> by using the same command found in <code>test.sh</code>, but I
don't know whether every part of the program will work correctly.</p>
<h2 id="tests-directory"><a class="header" href="#tests-directory">Tests Directory</a></h2>
<p>Below is a view of the <code>projects</code> directory, the <code>tests</code> directory, and their
contents (assuming you set up the project folders and unpacked the test program
correctly):</p>
<pre><code>projects/
├── final/
├── project1/
├── project2/
├── project3/
└── tests/
    ├── bin/
    ├── logs/
    ├── res/
    ├── src/
    ├── student/
    ├── build
    ├── LICENSE.txt
    ├── README.txt
    └── test.sh
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>logs</code> and <code>student</code> directories are not included in the zip, but the
program will create them when it runs.</p>
<p>You should never need to edit anything in the <code>tests</code> directory or any of its
subdirectories. <strong>The test program may overwrite any files inside of the
<code>tests</code> directory or its subdirectories, so don't keep any of your own files in
there</strong>. As long as you know not to use the <code>tests</code> directory for your own
documents, you don't need to be familiar with anything inside that folder to
use the program.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bin</code> contains the compiled Java code (<strong>binary</strong> files such as .class and
.jar files) for the test programs</li>
<li><code>res</code> contains <strong>resources</strong> used by the tests, such as inputs, expected
outputs, and supplementary jshell scripts</li>
<li><code>logs</code> contains logs generated by the test program</li>
<li><code>src</code> contains the Java <strong>source</strong> code for the tests</li>
<li><code>student</code> contains modified copies and compiled versions of your code used by
the tests, backup copies so the status command can check for changes, and a
record of the last test for each project</li>
<li><code>build</code> is the bash script that I use to compile the test program</li>
<li><code>LICENSE.txt</code> is the text of the MIT license, which applies to this test
program</li>
<li><code>README.txt</code> is a text file containing some of the documentation provided
here</li>
<li><code>test.sh</code> is the aforementioned shell script that launches the test program</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="test-logs"><a class="header" href="#test-logs">Test Logs</a></h2>
<p>When the test program runs, it will write information about what it's doing to
a log file. This file isn't usually going to be helpful unless I need to help
you troubleshoot an unusual problem or find and fix a bug in my test code. All
of these files are saved to the <code>tests/logs</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="backup-copy-of-student-code"><a class="header" href="#backup-copy-of-student-code">Backup Copy of Student Code</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the program saves a backup copy of your code so that the
status command can check whether your program has changed since it was last
tested. While I'm calling this a &quot;backup copy,&quot; you should not rely on it to
back up your work for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the most recently-tested version of your project is saved, and the
backup file(s) are overwritten every time you run the test command with that
project.</li>
<li>The <code>tests</code> folder is in the same location as your project folders, which
means a mishap that causes you to lose your projects will probably delete the
tests folder and any backup copies it contains.</li>
<li>If you start editing this file, then your work will be lost (probably with no
way to recover it) as soon as you run the test command with that project.
This is why I cautioned you earlier not to keep any of your own files inside
of the <code>tests</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep your work backed up separately with a cloud storage service such as
Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. If you know how to use version control
software such as git, then keep your work backed up in a remote repository. If
you lose work that was saved when testing your program, then it won't hurt to
check whether the backup copy includes some of the lost work, but don't count
on it helping you prevent data loss. That's not why it's there, and I don't
want it to give anyone a false sense of security.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="download"><a class="header" href="#download">Download</a></h1>
<p>Download the latest version of the tests below or from our shared OneDrive
folder. If you are experiencing an error with the test program, then you should
make sure you have the most recent version before reporting the error to me.
You can check which version you are running with the <code>version</code> command. The
older versions are archived here as well just in case there's an unexpected
issue with the latest version or someone needs to check an older version for
some reason.</p>
<p>Latest version:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="testing/../archives/tests_0_4_1.zip">tests_0_4_1.zip</a>
<ul>
<li>When updating from 0.2.0 or earlier, you should first delete your old
<code>tests</code> folder. The directory structure inside of <code>tests</code> has changed
enough that many obsolete files from previous versions will be left after
the update. The records of previous passing tests will not carry over, so
you'll also need to re-test your projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Previous versions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="testing/../archives/tests_0_4_0.zip">tests_0_4_0.zip</a></li>
<li><a href="testing/../archives/tests_0_3_2.zip">tests_0_3_2.zip</a></li>
<li><a href="testing/../archives/tests_0_2_0.zip">tests_0_2_0.zip</a></li>
<li><a href="testing/../archives/tests_0_1_0.zip">tests_0_1_0.zip</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anti-virus-false-positives"><a class="header" href="#anti-virus-false-positives">Anti-Virus False Positives</a></h2>
<p>Some anti-virus programs may flag the test zip as malware and quarantine it.
This is a false positive, and you may need to look up how to tell your
anti-virus program not to block or quarantine the test program download.</p>
<h2 id="unpacking"><a class="header" href="#unpacking">Unpacking</a></h2>
<p>You only need to unpack the program when you first download it or when you
download a new version. To unpack the program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the downloaded zip archive in your <code>projects</code> folder.</li>
<li>Open your terminal and navigate to your <code>projects</code> folder.</li>
<li>Run the command <code>unzip tests_VERSION.zip</code> (replace VERSION with whatever
version number appears in the zip folder name) to unpack the test files into
your <code>projects/tests</code> folder. For example, if the test zip is named
<code>tests_0_2_0.zip</code>, then you would unzip it by running <code>unzip tests_0_2_0.zip</code>.</li>
<li>If you already have a tests folder from a previous version, then the unzip
command will ask you about each duplicate file to make sure you want to
replace them. You can choose 'All' to say yes to every file without having
to go through the prompts. You can also include the <code>-o</code> flag after the
unzip command if you want it to overwrite files without prompting you.</li>
<li>You don't need the zip folder after you've extracted the contents. I
recommend deleting it so you don't clutter your projects folder with old
versions of the test program.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="testing-guide"><a class="header" href="#testing-guide">Testing Guide</a></h1>
<p>This section is a walkthrough covering how to test and submit your guided
projects. Make sure you've downloaded and unpacked the test program as directed
in the <a href="testing/./download.html">download section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="usage-summary"><a class="header" href="#usage-summary">Usage Summary</a></h2>
<p>You should always run this program from your projects directory (where you have
your project1, project2, project3, final, and tests folders) by entering <code>sh tests/test.sh &lt;command&gt;</code> on the terminal. Replace <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> with one of the
commands described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>help</code> prints a help message for the program or a specific command.</li>
<li><code>version</code> prints the program's version.</li>
<li><code>status</code> checks the current status of each of your projects: whether the
expected files/folders were found, whether you've previously tested that
project, and whether it is currently passing the tests.</li>
<li><code>test</code> runs the tests for one or more projects.</li>
<li><code>pack</code> zips the files for every guided project that has passed its tests to
prepare them for upload to Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>When running this program, make sure you read any error messages it shows you.
I've tried to include error messages that cover common problems you may
encounter. I expect you to try following any directions in the error messages
and using the help command before asking me why something isn't working.</p>
<h2 id="1-status-check"><a class="header" href="#1-status-check">1. Status Check</a></h2>
<p>Before testing a project, you should use the status command to determine which
projects can be found and whether they were previously recorded passing or
failing their tests. The status command's output looks like this (as of version
0.2.0):</p>
<pre><code>Project 1.1

Required project files:
	(FILE FOUND) project1/part1/CharacterSheet1.jsh

Last recorded test:
	Result: PASS
	Tested: 2024-03-11T16:33:02.912216789
	Modified since last test: NO

Project 1.2

Required project files:
	(FILE MISSING) project1/part2/CharacterSheet2.jsh

Last recorded test:
	No record found
</code></pre>
<p>To further explain this output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required project files: this lists each file that should exist for the
project and where it should be located inside your projects folder. If will
also say whether the file was found, is missing, or was found but
miscapitalized. If your file was not found or was miscapitalized, then you
may have named a file or folder incorrectly.</li>
<li>Last recorded test: as of version 0.2.0, the test program will save the
overall result of each test and a backup copy of your code in the
<code>tests/student</code> folder. If the status command can find those files, then it
will show the following information:
<ul>
<li>Result: whether the last test passed or failed.</li>
<li>Tested: the date and time on which the last test was completed.</li>
<li>Modified since last test: whether there is a difference between your
current code and the backup copy saved during the last test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your project's required files were all found, then you should be able to
test that project. If the required files were found, the last test passed, and
the files haven't been modified since that last test, then you should be ready
to submit that project on Blackboard (using the pack command to zip everything
first).</p>
<h2 id="2-testing-a-project"><a class="header" href="#2-testing-a-project">2. Testing a Project</a></h2>
<p>To test a project, run the test command followed by the number of the project
you want to test (1.1, 1.2, etc.). For example, <code>sh tests/test.sh test 1.1</code>
would run the tests for project 1.1.</p>
<p>If you entered a valid project number, the program will attempt to run all of
the tests for that project with your code. This may take a minute or two. After
it's finished, you should see a message informing you that the test is
complete. You can now check the test results with the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>summary</code> displays a summary of the entire set of tests. If your program
passed every test case, then the overall result should say <code>PASS</code>. If any
tests failed, timed out, or unexpectedly crashed, then the overall result
should say <code>FAIL</code>.
<ul>
<li>If a test timed out, then your program may have an error that causes it
to run for an extended period of time (such as an infinite loop). You
should run your program manually to make sure this isn't the issue.</li>
<li>If a test crashed, then there was an unexpected error while the test was
running. This could be a bug in the test program, and I recommend
rerunning the test to see if it happens again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>list</code> lists a summary of each individual test case: the test case's id
number, whether that test case passed or failed, and how many lines of the
expected output matched your output</li>
<li><code>code</code> shows your code used in the test case</li>
<li><code>show</code> displays information about a specific test case. You can specify what
information to show, or let the command print everything it has for that test
case. A test case can contain a lot of information, so you may need to scroll
up to see all of it.</li>
<li><code>help</code> provides information about the commands you can run while browsing
test results.</li>
<li><code>quit</code> stops browsing the test results and moves on to the next project (if
you're testing multiple projects) or exits the test program. The details of
these test results are not saved, so you won't be able to view them again
without rerunning the test.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpreting-test-results"><a class="header" href="#interpreting-test-results">Interpreting Test Results</a></h3>
<p>A failed test case can contain several useful pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The input shows what input was provided to your code. This may include two
categories:
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Input</strong> shows what the user typed on the terminal. You can
replicate this part of the test input by running your code and typing
exactly what you see in this section or using I/O redirection.</li>
<li><strong>Function Parameters (Before)</strong> shows what values were passed to your
function when it was called. This is not applicable to jshell scripts,
but compiled Java programs will always be tested by calling one of their
functions. You can replicate this part of the input by calling the
function being tested and passing identical values as arguments. The
<strong>(Before)</strong> means that this is what the parameters looked like before
your code ran. Some parameters may be mutable objects (such as arrays),
which makes it possible for your code to modify them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The student output shows the result of running your code. There are three
possible categories included in the output:
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Output</strong> shows what the program printed when running.</li>
<li><strong>Function Parameters (After)</strong> shows what the function parameters looked
like after running your code. This only applies to compiled Java tests,
and it will only matter when the parameters include mutable objects such
as arrays.</li>
<li><strong>Function Return Value</strong> shows what the function returned at the end of
the test. This only applies to compiled Java programs, and it will only
show up when testing a function with a return type other than <code>void</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The expected program output the expected results of running code that meets
all of the project's requirements. It will include the same categories as the
student output. If any of these don't match your output, then the test case
will fail.</li>
<li>The errors section shows any error messages that occurred while the test case
was running.</li>
<li>The additional feedback section may contain more information about the test
case or hints about common mistakes that would cause this test case to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're looking at the output sections, you'll see each line labelled as
&quot;MATCH&quot;, &quot;NO MATCH&quot;, or &quot;ERROR&quot;. These labels are there to help you find the
mistakes in your program's output that caused it to fail this test case.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MATCH</code> means this line was found in both your output and the expected
output. Every line in the expected output must match for the test to pass.</li>
<li><code>NO MATCH</code> means this line of output didn't match the expected output and
will therefore be ignored when determining whether the test passed. This is
used for your program's output that doesn't match the expected output because
your code is allowed to print extra output.</li>
<li><code>ERROR</code> means this line of the output didn't match and caused the test to
fail. This is used for all function-related output (parameters after and
return value), as well as the expected program output. All of this output
must match exactly for your code to pass the test case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-packing-and-submitting-a-project"><a class="header" href="#3-packing-and-submitting-a-project">3. Packing and Submitting a Project</a></h2>
<p>After a project passes its tests, you need to put all of your project files in
a single zip folder before uploading them to Blackboard. You can do this
manually, or you can use the test program's <code>pack</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="with-pack-command"><a class="header" href="#with-pack-command">With <code>pack</code> Command</a></h3>
<p>Run the test program with the <code>pack</code> command to copy the files for every
project that has passed its tests into a zip folder. You can then upload this
zip folder to Blackboard. <strong>Warning</strong>: remember to check the contents of the
zip before uploading it and make sure it contains everything you were
expecting. My program most likely packed everything correctly, but it's always
possible that it missed something due to a bug.</p>
<h3 id="manually-create-zip"><a class="header" href="#manually-create-zip">Manually Create Zip</a></h3>
<p>If you want to create the zip folder manually, then you need to check that all
of your files and folders are named correctly. The <code>status</code> command should take
care of this, and it will also let you know whether that project was previously
recorded passing its tests. You should be able to select all of your project
folders, right-click, and then compress or create a new zip folder (the exact
command will depend on your operating system).</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>zip</code> command on the terminal. You'll need to specify the
full path to each file this way. For example, the command to zip projects 1.1
and 1.2 would look like this: <code>zip guided_project_submission.zip project1/part1/CharacterSheet1.jsh project1/part2/CharacterSheet2.jsh</code></p>
<p>Be aware that if files or folders are misnamed (either incorrect spelling or
incorrect capitalization), then the scripts I use to process submissions will
not handle your files correctly and I will not mark them as complete. This is
why I gave you the <code>pack</code> and <code>status</code> commands: to check that everything is
ready to submit and zip it correctly. If you don't want to use them, then you
need to take care to name and package the files exactly as required before
submitting them. Don't create the zip manually to avoid fixing a problem the
<code>pack</code> or <code>status</code> command warned you about.</p>
