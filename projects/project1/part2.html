<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This program requires two additional pieces of input. Prompt the player for
their character's ancestry and class after the character name and before the
level. Test these new prompts like you tested the prompts in 1.1: run the
program, make sure the prompts appear, and make sure the variables have the
expected value after all of the prompts are finished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the user enters invalid input, then our program must print an error
message and exit. You should modify your prompts to tell the user what input
is allowed for the ancestry, class, level, and ability scores. This will be
a helpful reminder when you test the program.</p>
<p>Note: You can check each input value immediately after the prompt, or you
can check all of them in a separate section of your program after all of the
input is finished. The first option will give a better user experience
because you will know right away when you make a mistake, and you won't
waste time entering more input before the program exits. It also makes your
program faster to test for the same reasons. The second option makes it a
little easier to organize the code, and all of the error-checking could be
combined into one if statement. I recommend the first option because I
believe you'll benefit the most from the ease of testing. My directions will
only describe how to code this option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an if statement after the level prompt. A <em>valid</em> level is an integer
between 1 and 20, inclusive. We want to check whether it is <em>invalid</em>, so we
need a condition that asks whether the level is outside of this range. An
invalid level is <strong>either</strong> less than 1 <strong>or</strong> greater than 20. There are
two parts to this condition, so we need to join them with an AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) or
an OR (<code>||</code>). In this case, we should use OR. There are a couple of ways to
determine that OR is appropriate: the wording of the condition when we
describe it in English only makes sense with the word &quot;or&quot;, and we only need
to meet one of these two conditions for the level to be invalid (it's not
even possible for it to be both less than 1 and greater than 20 at the same
time). In the body of our if statement, we need to print an error message
and exit our program. The exact error message is <code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code>, and
we can exit the program with <code>System.exit(1);</code>. Any integer is a valid
argument for the <code>System.exit</code> function, but a value other than 0 means the
program encountered an error. All together, the prompt with error checking
would look something like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// prompt for input
System.out.println(&quot;level prompt message&quot;);
int variableName = nextInt();

// check for invalid input
if (/*TODO: condition*/) {
    println(&quot;ERROR: INVALID INPUT&quot;);
    // The /exit command won't work here because this whole block is part of a
    // Java code snippet. Jshell expects everything in a snippet to be valid
    // Java code.
    exit(1);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>You can use a similar prompt to check each ability score. The ability scores
must be integers between 8 and 15 inclusive. After you add the
error-checking for the level and abilities, you should test each of them a
few times. Try a few values inside and outside the range, and make sure the
program exits with the error message if and only if you enter a value
outside the range. In particular, you should check the boundaries of the
range. One of the most common mistakes in this type of code is to make a
range inclusive when it should have been exclusive, or to make it exclusive
when it should have been inclusive. If you make that mistake, then your code
will work correctly for all but one or two numbers. You should check 0, 1,
20, and 21 for the level, as well as 7, 8, 15, and 16 for each ability
score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once your error-checking code works for the numbers, you also need to check
the ancestry and class. Each of these have three options, and the user's
input is invalid if it is not equal to one of these options. This means we
have three parts to our condition, and they must be joined with AND or OR.
Which is appropriate? Let's try describing invalid input more closely to how
we would code it (checking each possibility separately) and see whether AND
or OR is more natural: an invalid ancestry is <strong>not</strong> an elf <strong>and</strong> it is
<strong>not</strong> a dwarf <strong>and</strong> it is <strong>not</strong> a human. Therefore we should use AND
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</p>
<p>However, this can be tricky. There's another way to phrase our condition
that sounds natural and uses OR instead of AND: &quot;an invalid ancestry is not
an elf, dwarf, <strong>or</strong> human&quot;. Does this mean it doesn't matter whether we
use AND or OR? No, it still matters. The trick with this phrase is how it
looks when structured like code: &quot;it is <strong>not</strong> true that (an invalid
ancestry is an elf <strong>or</strong> it is a dwarf <strong>or</strong> it is a human).&quot; We are using
<strong>or</strong> to join several equality checks (instead of inequality checks), then
applying the NOT (<code>!</code>) to the entire expression, which I've indicated by
wrapping most of the expression in parenthesis.</p>
<p>You'll develop an intuition for boolean logic with practice, so don't worry
if you had a hard time with this part. I'll summarize everything you need to
know for the AND solution to this error check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether the ancestry/class is NOT equal to each option.</li>
<li>Join each of these comparisons with AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</li>
<li>Never compare strings with <code>s1 == s2</code> or <code>s1 != s2</code>. This will not work
as you want it to. Instead, compare them using the <code>.equals</code> function:
<code>s1.equals(s2)</code> for equality and <code>!s1.equals(s2)</code> for inequality.</li>
<li>Valid ancestries are &quot;elf&quot;, &quot;human&quot;, and &quot;dwarf&quot;.</li>
<li>Valid classes are &quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;rogue&quot;, and &quot;ranger&quot;.</li>
<li>Use the lowercase versions of these names. You're free to assume all the
user's input for class and ancestry will be lowercase, and I will only
use lowercase input for these traits when testing your code. However, if
you want your program to ignore case, then you can modify the code that
reads their input for class and ancestry by changing <code>nextLine()</code> to
<code>nextLine().toLowerCase()</code>. This will convert any capital letters in the
user input to lowercase letters. Another solution is to use
<code>.equalsIgnoreCase</code> instead of <code>.equals</code>, which will let you check for
equality while preserving the user's capitalization. If we use
<code>.equalsIgnoreCase</code> and don't convert the input to lowercase, then our
output will use the same capitalization as the user. This may or may not
be desirable; it depends on how you want the output to look.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to test your new error-checking code. You should now get an error
message if you don't enter a valid ancestry or class, but the program should
still work if you enter valid input for everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we need to update the calculations. We can break this into three phases:
adjust ability scores, calculate ability modifiers, and calculate other
values. We'll start with adjusting the ability scores. Each ancestry changes
one or more ability scores. Humans increase all of their scores by 1, elves
increase their dexterity by 2, and dwarves increase their constitution by 2.
You can structure this part as an else-if chain:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (variableName.equals(&quot;ancestry1&quot;)) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 1
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;ancestry2&quot;)) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 2
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;ancestry3&quot;)) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 3
} else {
    // We don't need this, but it can make debugging easier. If we made a
    // mistake in our error-checking code and allowed an invalid ancestry, or
    // if we add more ancestries later and forget to update this part, then
    // we'll see this error message and know we made a mistake. This error
    // message is for us, not the user. We should only see it if our code is
    // wrong.
    println(&quot;ERROR: UNRECOGNIZED ANCESTRY! SKIPPING ADJUSTMENTS&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>After you adjust ability scores for the character's ancestry, you need to
calculate each ability's modifier. This is a separate number from the score,
and it's used in most calculations that care about the ability instead of
the raw score. The <a href="../project1.html#background">Project 1 Background</a> section
explains the difference between ability scores and modifiers in more detail.</p>
<p>The SRD has a table showing the modifier for each ability score. However, we
can more easily calculate this with a short formula: <code>abilityModifier = (abilityScore / 2) - 5</code>. The parenthesis aren't necessary, but they
emphasize the order of operations. Dividing after subtraction
(<code>(abilityScore - 10) / 2</code>) would not give us the correct modifier for some
scores below ten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="#calculations">Calculations</a> section covers the remaining calculations
you need to perform. You can find the relevant formulas and other
information there. Some of these calculations change depending on the class,
so you should use an else-if chain similar to what you wrote for the
ancestry adjustments. However, make sure you declare any variables <em>before</em>
the start of the if-else chain. If you declare a variable inside an if or
else body, then that variable will only exist inside that code block, and it
won't be available later when you perform other calculations or print your
output. Here's an outline to get started:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Declare all new variables here
int hp = 0;
// TODO: other variables

if (variableName.equals(&quot;class1&quot;)) {

<li>Test your code. We haven't updated the output yet, but you can run the
program and check the value of each variable from the calculations section
to make sure it's what you were expecting.</li>
<li>Finally, you can adjust the output to follow the <a href="#io-format">new format</a>
for 1.2 and show all of the new information you've calculated. Two of the
formatting requirements can be tricky to figure out: adding a plus to any
nonnegative modifiers and right-aligning the ability scores. You can use if
statements to handle this, but the <code>printf</code> function solves this problem
much more easily than an if statement. I won't explain <code>printf</code> here, so
read the notes if you aren't familiar with it. The formatting specifiers
you'll need are <code>%2d</code> to right-align an ability score and <code>%+d</code> to force a
plus or minus sign in front of an ability modifier.</li>

<p>Make sure you have downloaded my test code and extracted it to
<code>projects/tests</code>. You can run the test script with the command <code>sh tests/test.sh</code> followed by the name of the project you would like to test. You
can run <code>sh tests/test.sh help</code> for a list of options.</p>
<p>Run the tests for your project and look at the feedback. If your code passed
every test, then this Guided Project is finished. You can package all of your
projects for upload to Blackboard with the command <code>sh tests/test.sh pack</code>.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables"><a class="header" href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your <code>CharacterSheet2.jsh</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for a guided project to count as complete, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be submitted on Blackboard before the final deadline</li>
<li>packaged and named correctly (use the test script's pack command)</li>
<li>pass all of the tests I gave you</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be easy to tell whether your project is complete as long as you run
the tests. If it's not passing and you can't figure out why, then ask for help
rather than submitting an incomplete assignment.</p>
<h2 id="additional-details"><a class="header" href="#additional-details">Additional Details</a></h2>
<h3 id="io-format"><a class="header" href="#io-format">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>A Guided Project program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's ancestry (String)</li>
<li>The character's class (String)</li>
<li>The character's level (int)</li>
<li>The character's ability scores
<ul>
<li>Strength (int)</li>
<li>Dexterity (int)</li>
<li>Constitution (int)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If all user input is valid, then your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Character: &lt;NAME&gt;, level &lt;LEVEL&gt; &lt;ANCESTRY&gt; &lt;CLASS&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>HP: &lt;HP&gt;, AC: &lt;AC&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Ability Scores:</code></li>
<li><code>Str &lt;STRENGTH SCORE&gt; &lt;STRENGTH MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Dex &lt;DEXTERITY SCORE&gt; &lt;DEXTERITY MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Con &lt;CONSTITUTION SCORE&gt; &lt;CONSTITUTION MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Attacks:</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK1 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK1 MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK2 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK2 MODIFIER&gt;</code> (note: some characters only have one
attack)</li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a score (strength, dexterity, and constitution) is a single-digit number,
then it must be padded with an extra space so that all scores are
right-aligned in their column.</li>
<li>Each modifier (strength, dexterity, constitution, and attack) must be
preceded by a plus or minus sign. Negative modifiers have a minus sign, and
nonnegative (which includes zero) modifiers have a plus sign. This reinforces
how these numbers are meant to be used: they are usually added to dice rolls
and other values rather than used on their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability scores and attacks should also be indented (as shown in the example
below), but this will not be checked by the tests.</p>
<p>Here is an example of possible user input and the resulting character sheet:</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code>Alice
Bob
elf
ranger
4
15
14
9
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Player: Alice
Character: Bob, level 4 elf ranger
HP: 28, AC: 17
Ability Scores:
    Str 15 (+2)
    Dex 16 (+3)
    Con  9 (-1)
Attacks:
    Longsword +4
    Longbow +5
</code></pre>
<h3 id="valid-input"><a class="header" href="#valid-input">Valid Input</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways for the user to enter invalid input:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user can enter a string or double when you were expecting an integer. If
the user entered the word &quot;nine&quot; or the number 12.4 when asked for their
level, then this would be the wrong <em>type</em> of input.</li>
<li>The user can enter the correct <em>type</em> of input, but not one of the values
they were allowed to enter. If the user entered -2 or 50 when asked for
their level, then this would be the correct type of input (an integer), but
not one of the integers they were allowed to choose for their level (a
number from 1 to 20).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first kind of error is more complicated to deal with, and you probably
won't learn how to handle those errors until later in the semester. You only
need to worry about the second kind of error in this assignment. You can assume
that the user will always enter the correct type of value, but your code must
check whether it was one of the values they were allowed to choose. If the user
enters any invalid input, then your program must print the message <code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code> and exit.</p>
<p>Here are all of the rules you must enforce when checking the user's input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The level must be an integer from 1 to 20.</li>
<li>Each ability score must be an integer from 8 to 15.</li>
<li>The ancestry must be either &quot;human&quot;, &quot;elf&quot;, or &quot;dwarf&quot;.</li>
<li>The class must be either &quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;ranger&quot;, or &quot;rogue&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assume that the user's input for class and ancestry are always
lowercase. Your code <em>must</em> correctly handle the lowercase versions of these
strings, but it doesn't matter what you do when given other capitalizations
(such as &quot;Human&quot;, &quot;RANGER&quot;, or &quot;DwARf&quot;). You can treat those as invalid and
just print an error message (easiest to code but less user-friendly), or you
can make your code case-insensitive so that the capitalization does not matter
(harder to code but more user-friendly). However you decide to handle the
input, the ancestry and class <strong>must</strong> appear as all lowercase in the program's
output.</p>
<h3 id="calculations"><a class="header" href="#calculations">Calculations</a></h3>
<p>This program involves more calculations and variables than the previous
program. This section will serve as a reference for all values that are
calculated by the program.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before any other calculations, some of the ability <strong>scores</strong> must be
adjusted by the player's ancestry:
<ul>
<li>If the character is a human, increase each ability score by one.</li>
<li>If the character is an elf, increase their dexterity score by two.</li>
<li>If the character is a dwarf, increase their constitution score by two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each ability score has an associated number called its <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores">modifier</a>. The modifier <em>does not alter
the score</em>, it is derived <em>from</em> the score. The srd link has a table showing
the modifier associated with each score from 1 to 30, but we can calculate
the modifier with a formula.
<ul>
<li>Each ability modifier is calculated by dividing the score by 2 and
subtracting 5. The formula should look like this: <code>modifier = score / 2 - 5</code>.</li>
<li>It's important that you divide <em>before</em> subtracting because integer
division will round towards zero, not down. We could perform a similar
calculation by subtracting 10 and then dividing by 2, but this would give
the wrong value for odd ability scores below 10. For example, a score of
9 would produce a modifier of 0 when it should have a modifier of -1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character's HP equals their level multiplied by the sum of their
constitution modifier and their &quot;hit die&quot;. The hit die is determined by the
character's class. A fighter has a hit die of 10, and the other two classes
have a hit die of 8. The formula should look like this: <code>hp = level * (conModifier + hitDie)</code>.</li>
<li>The character's AC (armor class) uses a different formula depending on their
class:
<ul>
<li>A fighter's AC is equal to 18</li>
<li>A ranger's AC is equal to 15 plus their dexterity modifier, but their AC
cannot be higher than 17</li>
<li>A rogue's AC is equal to 12 plus their dexterity modifier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character's proficiency is not displayed, but it is used to calculate
their attack bonus. It uses the formula <code>proficiency = 1 + (level + 3) / 4</code>.</li>
<li>Depending on their class, the character has one or two attacks. Each attack
has a name and a bonus. The bonus is equal to the character's proficiency
bonus plus one of their ability modifiers.
<ul>
<li>A fighter has one attack called <code>Greatsword</code>, which uses their strength
modifier</li>
<li>A rogue has two attacks: <code>Dagger</code> and <code>Crossbow</code>, which both use their
dexterity modifier</li>
<li>A ranger has two attacks: <code>Longsword</code>, which uses their strength
modifier, and <code>Longbow</code>, which uses their dexterity modifier</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
