<p>So far we've been using a simplified version of the D&amp;D 5e rules. Now it's time
to modify these rules to either bring them closer to the real D&amp;D rules or
change them to something you find more interesting. You're free to change them
however you want as long as you stick to the constraints listed below. You'll
also need to document your new rules in the write-up later.</p>
<p>You have a lot of freedom with how you design these new rules. If you want to
do something that doesn't fit with the constraints, then you can always ask me
first. The constraints are there to ensure you aren't oversimplifying the
rules, and I'm happy to allow exceptions as long as you get them approved ahead
of time. Try to have fun and embrace your creativity with this assignment. You
could make rules for a Transformers RPG, a dentistry management simulator, or a
game about cats that knock things off shelves.</p>
<h4 id="redesign-constraints"><a class="header" href="#redesign-constraints">Redesign Constraints</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>You need to include at least four <strong>primary stats</strong> (example: <strong>ability
scores</strong>) that the user can enter or generate using the system you create in
<a href="#task-2-stat-generation">Task 2</a>. These stats, or numbers derived from them
(example: <strong>ability modifiers</strong>), should be used in most of your
calculations. If you stick with D&amp;D, then you must include <strong>all six ability
scores</strong> as primary stats and use their modifiers in calculations.</li>
<li>You need to include at least two kinds of traits (example: <strong>class</strong> and
<strong>ancestry</strong>). The user should be able to pick from several options for each
trait, and the traits should have an effect on some of your program's other
calculations. If you stick with D&amp;D, then you need to choose at least three
options for class and ancestry that weren't used in the previous versions of
this assignment. You should try to make these function similarly to how they
are described in the D&amp;D rules.</li>
<li>You need properties other than your primary stats. Most of these should be
calculated by your code (example: <strong>hp</strong> and <strong>ac</strong>) and not directly entered
by the user (example: <strong>level</strong>).</li>
<li>You need to include multiple &quot;layers&quot; of calculations. In the D&amp;D rules our
ability scores determined ability modifiers, and the ability modifiers
determined other stats (like hp, ac, and attack bonuses).</li>
</ul>
<p>You're free to include other input and choices for the user to make, but don't
make it too complicated. You can always start off with a simple design and then
build up to something more complex. Add one new feature at a time and make sure
the program still works before moving on to the next.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-stat-generation"><a class="header" href="#task-2-stat-generation">Task 2: Stat Generation</a></h3>
<p>D&amp;D has two commonly-used methods for determining your character's ability
scores: dice and point buy. You will implement similar methods to determine the
character's primary stats in your game.</p>
<h4 id="dice-method"><a class="header" href="#dice-method">Dice Method</a></h4>
<p>In early editions of D&amp;D you would roll three six-sided dice and sum the result
to determine each ability score. If you rolled a 3, 6, and 2 for your strength,
then your strength score would be 11. Then you might roll a 4, 6, and 6 and end
up with a 16 for your dexterity.</p>
<p>This method does not produce very good characters, and it doesn't give the
player a lot of choice over the type of character they play. More recent
editions of D&amp;D have you roll four dice, ignore the lowest number, and add the
other three together. You roll six scores, and then you can assign each score
to one of your abilities. The &quot;4d6 and drop the lowest&quot; method gives higher
numbers for better characters, and assigning the scores in any order lets the
player choose what kind of character to build.</p>
<h4 id="point-buy-method"><a class="header" href="#point-buy-method">Point Buy Method</a></h4>
<p>D&amp;D 5e also has a point buy system. With point buy, each ability score can be
any number from 8 to 15, but these numbers have a point cost (shown in <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/character-creation-outline/">the
Ability Score Cost table</a> in
the SRD). You're only allowed to spend 27 points on your ability scores.
Ancestry adjustments are applied after you choose these numbers and do not
affect the point costs.</p>
<p>There are other variations in Pathfinder and earlier editions of D&amp;D, but this
is the system in 5e.</p>
<h4 id="your-program"><a class="header" href="#your-program">Your Program</a></h4>
<p>You need to implement two different methods for choosing a character's stats: a
random method (such as simulated dice rolls) and a nonrandom method (such as
point buy). The user should choose which method to use each time they create a
character.</p>
<p>The random method can be simple, like the original D&amp;D method of rolling 3d6
for each ability in order. It can also be more complex, like the modern method
of rolling 4d6, dropping the lowest value, and assigning the scores in any
order. The nonrandom method can also be as simple or complex as you want to
make it. You could ask for the scores in order, check the total point cost, and
exit with an error if the user didn't stay within the budget. You could also
handle invalid choices without exiting early and allow the user to change
previous choices until they're finished.</p>
<p>The same advice about simplicity applies here. It's easy to make this part of
the program too complicated, so start with a method that's easy to code and
then revise it later <em>if you want to</em>. This part is only as challenging as you
want to make it, and there's no impact on your grade if you stick with an
easier method that isn't as user-friendly. Go for something more challenging if
you're enjoying the program and want to make a better version or solve a more
difficult problem.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-loop"><a class="header" href="#task-3-loop">Task 3: Loop</a></h3>
<p>Dependeng on how you implemented your stat generation systems, you may have
already completed this task. I want you to use at least one loop in your
program. Ideally, this should be in a way that improves the code or enables you
to do something that you couldn't do without the loop.</p>
<p>If you don't want to use a loop for part of the stat generation, then I will
suggest one alternative: use a loop for more user-friendly error handling.
Rather than exiting the program with an error message upon receiving invalid
input, you can continue asking the user until they enter valid input. This
would not allow you to handle input that causes a runtime error (such as the
user typing &quot;a&quot; when you're attempting to read an integer), but it can handle
input that isn't allowed by your character creation rules (such as a level
above 20 in the D&amp;D 5e rules).</p>
<p>Here's a rough outline of this error-handling loop:</p>
<pre><code>ask user for input
read input
while input isn't valid
    tell user input wasn't valid and ask them to retry
    read input
</code></pre>
<p>You can find a more detailed example in the notes.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>After completing the program, answer the questions below in a separate
document. <strong>This is not an essay: do NOT double-space, and keep your answers to
each question separate</strong>. Your answers should be reasonably detailed and
address each question in full. I expect you to be accurate when describing your
project, but I'm otherwise not concerned with whether you provide the &quot;correct&quot;
answer to a question. Much of what I'm asking you for is your opinion or
analysis of your work. I want to know what <em>you</em> think so that I can assess
your understanding and provide useful feedback. If I disagree with you, then I
will explain why and offer suggestions without penalizing your grade.</p>
<p>Also, an important reminder: <strong>do not use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with
or complete the write-up for you</strong>. The whole point is for you to think
critically about and explain your code. I do not care what ChatGPT &quot;thinks&quot;
about your work. Form your own opinions and justify them as best you can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain your redesign of the game:
<ul>
<li>Summarize your new design and explain why you went with this design.</li>
<li>What are your primary stats? What do these stats tell us about the
character? What range of numbers can a character normally have for these
stats?</li>
<li>What traits can a character have? What options can the user choose from
for each trait? What do these traits tell us about the character?</li>
<li>What other properties does a character have? What does each property tell
us about the character? How is each property calculated?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explain how the user generates their stats:
<ul>
<li>How does the randomized method work? Is it simulating something that you
could easily do by hand, such as rolling dice?</li>
<li>How does the nonrandom method work? What range of numbers can the user
choose, and what constraints did you give them?</li>
<li>Did you include any features to make your program easier to use or give
the player more control over their stats? If so, what are these features?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explain how you used a loop in your program. Was the loop necessary to write
that part of the program, or could you have written that part without a
loop? If you used multiple loops, then you can choose just one to talk
about. Include the relevant code in your answer and note the line number(s)
where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion).
Explain why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend
more time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>

<ul>
<li>Your <code>CharacterSheet3.jsh</code> file</li>
<li>Your <code>writeup.pdf</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for an open-ended project to be considered complete, it must</p>
<ul>
<li>be submitted on Blackboard before the final deadline</li>
<li>compile and run without syntax errors</li>
<li>demonstrate that you have completed each task as directed</li>
<li>include a document that fully addresses each of the write-up questions</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ignore write-up questions, tasks, or the directions within a task, then
the project is incomplete. You can still resubmit an incomplete project, but
resubmitting after the deadline will incur a significant late penalty.</p>
