<p>This section assumes you understand the school's AI policy. I want to cover
some important details about how it applies in our class.</p>
<h2 id="permission-to-share-and-discuss-work"><a class="header" href="#permission-to-share-and-discuss-work">Permission to Share and Discuss Work</a></h2>
<p>I consider it <em>very</em> important that you feel comfortable discussing assignments
with other students. Your peers can be an excellent source of help and
feedback, and your own insights and feedback can be incredibly valuable to
them. To ensure that the school's AI policy does not penalize you for this, I
give you explicit permission to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may share any work you create for this class with anybody, including your
classmates.</li>
<li>You may publicly post work you create for this class.</li>
<li>You may use work you originally created for this class in an assignment for
another class as long as you get the other instructor's explicit written
permission first.</li>
<li>You may discuss assignments from this class with anybody. You may ask anybody
for help with them and view their work if they're willing to share it with
you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, you own all the work you do for this class, and that means you can
decide what you do with it. However, I need to clarify that this permission
does not extend to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not share work or post it publicly for the purpose of helping someone
else violate the school's AI policy. This includes if somebody asks you for
your work and informs you that they plan to copy it before you share the work
with them. This type of action is considered &quot;facilitation&quot; under the
school's AI policy.</li>
<li>You may not use work that you originally created for another class in any of
your assignments for this class without the explicit permission of both me
and the other class's instructor. The permission granted previously only
applies to reusing work <em>from</em> this class in another class, and you would
still need permission from that class's instructor. If you are ever unsure,
just ask me and the other instructor.</li>
<li>You may not copy your work from other people or from a large language model
(an &quot;AI&quot;). I'll cover this in more detail in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not consider you responsible for anyone's misuse of material that you
shared in good faith. I will always take your word regarding how you meant for
or expected your work to be used unless I have strong evidence that contradicts
you. If there's ever a question of whether you had permission to share work
from this class, please contact me and I will vouch for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-counts-as-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#what-counts-as-plagiarism">What Counts as Plagiarism?</a></h2>
<p>First and most important: <strong>in any situation where you have doubts or are
unsure whether something is allowed, ask me.</strong> It's always okay to ask whether
you <em>can</em> do something, and this is the best way to be sure that I won't treat
it as an AI violation.</p>
<p>This section exists for two reasons: to make it easier for someone who has
genuine questions to determine whether an action qualifies as cheating, and to
give me something to point to if somebody claims they didn't know their actions
qualified as cheating. Going through a series of flimsy excuses is one of the
most tedious parts of handling an AI violation, so I'd like to be thorough here
and save myself some trouble later.</p>
<p>The vast majority of AI violations that occur in this class involve plagiarism
on programming assignments, so that's what I will focus on. To keep my
descriptions short, I'll be using &quot;<strong>other work</strong>&quot; to refer to any work that
was created by somebody other than you or by an LLM (such as ChatGPT). The
following actions will nearly always qualify as cheating and/or plagiarism
(I'll note exceptions later):</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying the <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part, whether by copying the file,
copying and pasting the file's contents, or viewing the file and retyping the
same information by hand. Modifying the <strong>other work</strong> after copying it,
whether to disguise the plagiarism or &quot;make it your own&quot; does not change the
fact that it was copied. What matters is whether you copied work, not how you
copied it or what you did before or after copying it.</li>
<li>Paraphrasing the <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part. This is not meaningfully
different from copying, and it's often an attempt to disguise the copying and
provide some plausible deniability if caught.</li>
<li>Using the other work as a reference when creating your own work. This
normally ends up with you copying or paraphrasing as described above, but I
mention it because it's another common excuse.</li>
<li>Doing your work under the direction of another person. It's okay to talk to
someone about your work while you're working, but it's not okay to let them
dictate the code to you. If you're mostly writing what someone else tells you
to write, then you are not doing your own work. Try talking to them about
your problem, take some notes, and then go fix the problem after you're done
talking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions to the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use any material that I intentionally provide you (whether it's in my
notes, starter code, the assignment, or something I showed during class)
as-is or with modifications in your own work. I gave you that material so you
could use it, and you don't need to remind me about this. You can still
document your use of starter code or other resources that I provided if you
want to, it's just not necessary when submitting it in this class. If you
show the work outside of this class, then you'll probably want to be more
explicit about which parts you wrote yourself because that is no longer
obvious from context.</li>
<li>If you want to copy or paraphrase a portion of work from another source, then
you can as long as you do the following:
<ul>
<li>Discuss it with me first and get my permission to use the other work.</li>
<li>Clearly state which outside sources you used and provide a reliable link
or other means to access those sources.</li>
<li>Take great care to show what was taken from the other source and what is
your own original work. It should be immediately obvious to anyone
viewing your work which parts are from other sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two general rules I use if someone appears to have plagiarized but claims they
did not:</p>
<ul>
<li>If large sections of your code are identical or nearly identical to existing
code, then it isn't your work. If you are writing your own code and following
the guidelines I provide in this policy, then you should always end up with
significantly different code on all but the simplest programs.</li>
<li>If you don't understand your code and cannot explain how it works, then it
isn't your work. You should not be writing code that you don't understand,
and you are not going to accidentally write a working program that solves a
specific problem without some understanding of the code you're writing. If
your code doesn't appear to be something you realistically could have written
and you cannot explain how it works, then I will not accept it for an
assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism">Retaking this Class and Self-Plagiarism</a></h3>
<p>If you are retaking this class, then I expect you to complete every assignment
from scratch without reusing any of your old work. Reusing work from the last
time you took this class would be equivalent to reusing work you completed for
a different class. As stated earlier in this policy, you <strong>do not</strong> have my
permission to do this.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-and-llms"><a class="header" href="#chatgpt-and-llms">ChatGPT and LLMs</a></h2>
<p>You're free to discuss assignments with LLMs such as ChatGPT. However, I do not
recommend using them too heavily, and I want to warn you about some of their
limitations before I get into how they pertain to academic integrity. Despite
the colloquial term &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; these tools are not intelligent
and do not understand the conversation they are having with you. They are
complex algorithms running on powerful hardware, and they are very good at one
thing: using their training data to produce text that looks like something a
human might write in the context of your conversation. LLMs are prone to
hallucinating (making up false information), and they do not know when they are
hallucinating. If you don't understand the topic you're discussing well enough
to critically evaluate what ChatGPT tells you, then I think you're better off
talking to a human who does understand the topic.</p>
<p>I have a simple rule for how you may use material generated by an LLM: treat
anything it writes the way you would treat information you found by searching
the internet or information that someone else gave you. It is not your work,
and all of the restrictions I've already stated regarding &quot;other work&quot; apply.
You should also avoid asking an LLM to do something that you would not be
allowed to ask a human to do. Don't ask ChatGPT to rewrite or fix your work for
you. This would qualify as cheating. Instead, ask it questions so that you can
understand how to fix your work, and then <em>fix it yourself</em>.</p>
<p>If you are using ChatGPT for help with an assignment, then please save that
conversation so you can share it with me or the AI Office if your work is
called into question. This is an easy way to prove you used the tool
appropriately, and if you cannot or will not provide that evidence then I will
not give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h2 id="consequences-for-ai-violations"><a class="header" href="#consequences-for-ai-violations">Consequences for AI Violations</a></h2>
<p>Sanctions for AI violations are determined either by joint resolution, case
review, or a hearing. In a joint resolution, I must agree to any proposed
consequences, and in a case review or hearing I will still be consulted about
appropriate consequences. This section covers what I believe are appropriate
consequences <em>on a first offense</em> for most AI violations.</p>
<p>If you plagiarize, cheat, or otherwise violate the AI policy with work you
submit for an assignment, then under no circumstances will I consider it
appropriate to give you any credit for the assignment or allow you to attempt
the assignment again. This is the penalty stipulated in the grade contract for
not completing the entire assignment, not the penalty for cheating. If you
copied or cheated on even a small portion of the assignment, <strong>then you did not
complete the entire assignment</strong>; you completed <em>some</em> of the assignment and
then copied the remaining work. To give any credit would be a reward for
violating the AI policy.</p>
<p>In addition to enforcing the grade contract's penalty for incomplete work, I
consider the following penalties to be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>In cases of cheating on only a small part (let's say under ten percent) of
one or two assignments, an <em>additional</em> final grade penalty equal to half of
each assignment's incomplete penalty.</li>
<li>In more significant cases of cheating on a single assignment, an <em>additional</em>
final grade penalty equal to the assignment's incomplete penalty.</li>
<li>In cases of cheating on multiple assignments, a failing grade in the class.</li>
</ul>
<p>These additional penalties cannot be removed by changing your grade contract.
If you cheat on a project for the B contract, then the additional penalty will
still apply if you change to the C contract.</p>
