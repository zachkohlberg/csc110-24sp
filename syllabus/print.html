<h2 id="description"><a class="header" href="#description">Description</a></h2>
<p>CSC110 is an introduction to programming using the Java programming language
and the Jshell REPL. The primary focus of this class is developing
problem-solving skills and a general knowledge of programming that will be
useful to you in most programming languages. While we will spend a lot of time
learning about Java and how to write good code, writing code isn't our ultimate
goal. The most important skill you can learn in this class is how to <em>think</em>
like a programmer. Once you've mastered that, writing code is surprisingly
easy.</p>
<p>This syllabus also covers any sections of CSC110L that I am teaching this
semester. Policies specific to CSC110L are in the <a href="./lab.html">lab</a> section of
this syllabus. If you are taking the lab with a different instructor, then
refer to their lab syllabus.</p>
<h2 id="objectives"><a class="header" href="#objectives">Objectives</a></h2>
<p>CSC110 and CSC110L share objectives. Upon successful completion of both
courses, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss the challenges inherent in communicating with (programming) a
(non-reasoning) computer.</li>
<li>Break a complex problem down into smaller more manageable components.</li>
<li>Provide step-by-step instructions to solve small computational problems.</li>
<li>Using at least one programming language, write examples of and solve problems
in programs with the following basic programming constructs and tools:
<ul>
<li>Mathematical expressions</li>
<li>Conditional expressions</li>
<li>Simple iterative statements</li>
<li>Simple functions</li>
<li>Simple data structures, such as arrays, lists, and strings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discuss the importance of commenting and good code structure/style</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="syllabus-revisions"><a class="header" href="#syllabus-revisions">Syllabus Revisions</a></h1>
<p>If the syllabus needs to be revised during the semester, then any changes will
be noted here. I will also keep older versions of the syllabus available on
Blackboard so that there is a clear record of all changes.</p>
<p>Revision on 2024/02/13:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update lab make-up policy to allow make-up assignments during office hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Revision on 2024/03/29:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update grade contracts to remove projects 3.1 and 3.2 (you do not need to
resubmit the grade contract; this will apply retroactively to all contracts)</li>
</ul>
<p>Revision on 2024/04/20:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update grade contracts to lower the number of open-ended projects for the A
and B contracts</li>
<li>Update lab sections to explicitly state the (reduced) number of required lab
assignments</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="communication-and-office-hours"><a class="header" href="#communication-and-office-hours">Communication and Office Hours</a></h1>
<h2 id="office-hours"><a class="header" href="#office-hours">Office Hours</a></h2>
<p>My normal office hours are Tuesday from 2:00-3:30 PM EST in TH130. Feel free to
stop by during that time if you want to talk or work on assignments.</p>
<p>I am an adjunct (part-time) faculty and do not have an office on campus. I will
not usually be around outside of class meetings and office hours, but I don't
mind scheduling a remote meeting if you need to talk but can't make it to
office hours that week.</p>
<h2 id="blackboard"><a class="header" href="#blackboard">Blackboard</a></h2>
<p>You should be able to find all course material and links to submit each
assignment on this class's Blackboard page. If material is hosted on another
site, then there should still be a link on Blackboard. Remember that labs and
lectures are separate courses with separate Blackboard pages.</p>
<h2 id="email"><a class="header" href="#email">Email</a></h2>
<p>My email is <a href="mailto:zckohlberg@qu.edu">zckohlberg@qu.edu</a>. I usually check my email daily during the week
and will try to respond to all emails within 48 hours. If you email me after
the morning on Friday or over the weekend, then I may not get back to you until
Monday. You're still welcome to email me at any time during the semester (or
after, I love to hear how my former students are doing).</p>
<p>I can answer most questions via email if you don't want to ask in person. If
you're asking for help with an assignment, coding issue, or software, then
please try to include as much information as possible and be specific about
what you want to know (<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions">this blog post</a>
has excellent advice for asking productive questions). The more relevant
information you include in your email the faster I'll be able to help you.</p>
<p>If you need me to do something more involved than answer some questions, such
as review your code or help you debug a program, then you should meet with me
during office hours. I'm happy to help you with coding, debugging, and other
tasks as long as you're the one doing the task. You should not come to office
hours or email me expecting me to do your work for you.</p>
<h2 id="slackdiscord"><a class="header" href="#slackdiscord">Slack/Discord</a></h2>
<p>I may set up a Slack workspace or Discord server for the class. If I do, then
it will be linked on Blackboard. It gives us another channel for communication,
and it tends to be quicker and less formal than email. If we do have a Slack or
Discord, then its use will be optional.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="class-meetings"><a class="header" href="#class-meetings">Class Meetings</a></h1>
<p>In the event that I cannot attend a class in person, I will usually hold class
remotely via Zoom or find another faculty member to cover the meeting for me.
If I need to cancel class, then I will notify everyone as early as possible in
a Blackboard announcement.</p>
<h2 id="class-structure"><a class="header" href="#class-structure">Class Structure</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owWEDVTTa76W00ve5gbrSyLpZVm5zWrHtU02OR9eMrA/edit?usp=sharing">course schedule</a> will have the
agenda for each class meeting, and all activities and material from class will
be posted to Blackboard. If you want me to cover a specific topic or spend more
time on something, then let me know and I will try to fit it into the agenda
for an upcoming class.</p>
<p>I will try to include a mix of group activities, programming demos, and more
traditional lectures during class. You should show up to each class prepared
for what we're doing that day, which means completing any reading or other
homework assignments before class starts. It's not fair to the people you're
working with if you don't know what's going on, and you won't get as much out
of a lecture or demonstration if you skipped the reading.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy"><a class="header" href="#attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</a></h2>
<p>You should attend class whenever possible, but you do not need my permission to
miss class or leave early. You also don't need to explain every absence to me,
although I would appreciate knowing what's going on if you have to miss
multiple classes in a short period of time.</p>
<p>If you are feeling sick or suspect you may have COVID, the flu, or another
contagious illness, then please stay home and focus on recovering. You will be
fine if you miss a few classes, and you're not likely to get much out of class
if you are not feeling well. Attending class while sick also poses a risk to
everyone else.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="course-material"><a class="header" href="#course-material">Course Material</a></h1>
<h2 id="primary-resources"><a class="header" href="#primary-resources">Primary Resources</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notes</strong>: I'm in the process of writing and revising notes for all of the
topics we will cover in this class. They're available in HTML (recommended
version, linked on Blackboard) and as a PDF (also on Blackboard). You can
read these at your own pace, but at a minimum you should complete the
assigned readings to prepare for each week's classes. I will update the notes
frequently as I complete revisions and add new material.</li>
<li><strong>Class Activities/Examples</strong>: We will often write short programs during
class, either as part of a demo or when reviewing a group activity. I will
post all of these programs in a shared OneDrive folder linked on Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="supplemental-resources"><a class="header" href="#supplemental-resources">Supplemental Resources</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>: I plan to record some videos covering how to set up and use
certain software, how to set up and submit the guided projects, and possibly
other topics. These are a lower priority than most of my other prep work, so
the number of videos depends on how much extra time I have during the
semester.</li>
<li><strong>Textbooks</strong>: You do not need to purchase any textbooks for this class, but
I recommend using a textbook or other reliable source to read about the
topics we cover in more detail. I can recommend the book <a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Book%3A_Programming_Fundamentals_(Busbee_and_Braunschweig)/00%3A_Front_Matter/03%3A_Table_of_Contents">Programming and
Computation Fundamentals, by Busbee and
Braunschweig</a>,
which is available for free from &lt;libretexts.org&gt;. My notes may refer to this
book from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software"><a class="header" href="#software">Software</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text Editors</strong>: You need a text editor to edit code (Microsoft Word and
Google Docs are <strong>not</strong> text editors). I've listed a few options below. I
recommend picking one editor that you like and learning to use it well. Get
used to using your editor's keyboard shortcuts and you'll be able to work
very fast.
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></strong>: If I had to guess, I'd say
this is the most popular editor currently available. I recommend using it
unless you have a good reason to go with another editor. One caveat: I do
not use VS Code and have very little experience with it, and I cannot
provide technical support if you have trouble using it. However, due to
its popularity you should be able to find plenty of resources online.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a></strong>: This is the editor I use. It's harder
to learn than the other options in this list, but it's powerful and
highly configurable. If you want to spend more time initially learning
vim motions and various keyboard shortcuts, then it might be worth giving
neovim a try (or vim or emacs, which are both similar to neovim). This
might also be a good option if you like the idea of gradually customizing
your editor to suit your exact preferences. However, I think most people
will be happier with VS Code, so I don't recommend Neovim unless it
really appeals to you and you're fine with the learning curve.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></strong>: I like Notepad++, but
it's Windows only and I haven't used it in years. It still appears to be
receiving regular updates, so it should be a solid choice if you're using
Windows and don't like VS Code.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></strong>: I've never used
Sublime, but it was somewhat popular when I was a student. Like
Notepad++, it still appears to be receiving updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Java</strong>: This is the programming language we're using. You'll set up Java
during the first lab, and I'll post directions on Blackboard in case you need
to reinstall it in the future.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git Bash</a></strong>: We'll be using the terminal
regularly. I don't like the default terminal programs on Windows (cmd and
Powershell), and some of the scripts and commands I give you will not work in
either of them. Git for Windows comes with a decent terminal emulator, and I
highly recommend it over cmd and Powershell if you use Windows. If you're
using a Mac or Linux computer, then the default terminal program should be
fine.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">diagrams.net</a></strong>: This is like Google Docs for
flowcharts and other diagrams. It can also integrate with Google Drive and
allow multiple people to edit the same diagram, but some students have
reported issues with lag while doing this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Asking good questions is one of the best skills you can have as a student. In
my experience, very few people (myself included) ask questions as often as they
should, and it can be difficult to ask a question that will quickly lead to a
helpful answer. The blog posts below provide excellent advice for asking and
answering questions. I recommend giving them a quick read, especially if you
have trouble asking questions or often feel like the answers you get aren't
helpful.</p>

<p>The Java API is a useful reference. It may be intimidating right now, but the
more you learn about Java and programming, the more easily you'll be able to
navigate the API and use it to look up information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs//api/index.html">https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs//api/index.html</a></li>
<li>You can also Google &quot;java api&quot; and whatever part of the API you're trying to
use, and this will usually give you the right page as the first result. You
may get the documentation from older versions of Java if you do this, but
most of that documentation is still accurate for more recent versions.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h1>
<p>There are three types of assignments in the grade contracts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./assignments/guided_projects.html">Guided Projects</a></li>
<li><a href="./assignments/expanded_projects.html">Expanded Projects</a></li>
<li><a href="./assignments/final_project.html">Final Project</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We will also have reading assignments and other homework that isn't in your
grade contract. These are never graded, but they will usually prepare you for
an activity in the next class meeting.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="guided-projects"><a class="header" href="#guided-projects">Guided Projects</a></h1>
<p>Most of our projects will be larger programming problems broken into two-three
parts. The first two parts are called &quot;<strong>Guided Projects</strong>&quot;. The Guided
Projects contain step-by-step instructions, further breaking down their part of
the program into a series of small tasks. My goal for each Guided Project is to
have you practice solving many small problems while building up to a more
complex and interesting program. I've designed most of the program for you, but
you still need to figure out how to code each part using the information
provided.</p>
<h2 id="expectations"><a class="header" href="#expectations">Expectations</a></h2>
<p>Guided Projects require you to write and debug code. When working on these
projects, you should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the steps, completing the tasks in the order they are given.</li>
<li>Test your code as often as possible, especially when directed to in the
assignment.</li>
<li>Finish the current step and make sure it works correctly before moving on to
the next step. Moving on when you haven't fixed an error will make the error
harder to fix, make the next step more difficult, and lead to more mistakes
on the rest of the project. This is why frequent testing is important.</li>
<li>Run the test program included with the assignment after you've completed all
of the steps. If your work does not pass every test, then fix your mistakes
and re-test it until it passes.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to emphasize that both <strong>writing</strong> and <strong>debugging</strong> your code are
equally important parts of these projects. All programmers make mistakes, and
debugging is a crucial skill to learn. Be patient, take the time to learn why
code isn't working before you attempt to fix it, and resist the temptation to
take shortcuts.</p>
<h2 id="review"><a class="header" href="#review">Review</a></h2>
<p>I review Guided Projects by running the test program included with the
assignment. If your submission is packaged correctly and passes all tests, then
it is <strong>complete</strong>. I will try to review all new guided project submissions
weekly and update Blackboard to show which projects are complete.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="expanded-projects"><a class="header" href="#expanded-projects">Expanded Projects</a></h1>
<p><strong>Expanded Projects</strong> build on the program you wrote in the guided projects
that came before it. Instead of step-by-step instructions, you will have
several open-ended tasks to complete. These tasks will be more complicated than
the Guided Projects, and more of the details will be left up to you. Expanded
Projects don't normally include tests like the Guided Projects.</p>
<p>Each Expanded Project will also include a write-up. The write-up allows you to
show me how you designed parts of the program, reflect on the code you wrote,
and demonstrate your understanding of your program. I consider this to be
roughly as important as your code, so please put an appropriate amount of time
and thought into the written portion of your project.</p>
<h2 id="proposals"><a class="header" href="#proposals">Proposals</a></h2>
<p>You can propose a different set of tasks to replace the tasks I gave you in the
assignment (except for the write-up). Your alternative tasks must still meet
the Learning Objectives given at the beginning of the assignment. I will
provide a proposal template to use if you would like to modify an Expanded
Project.</p>
<p>If you are modifying an Expanded Project, then you must get your proposal
<strong>approved</strong> at least one week before you submit the project. This is to
encourage you to write the proposal early and before starting work on the
project. Keep in mind that you may need to revise the initial proposal before I
approve it, so it's best to submit proposals at least two to three weeks before
the project deadline.</p>
<h2 id="expectations-1"><a class="header" href="#expectations-1">Expectations</a></h2>
<p>Expanded Projects require you to write and test code, but with less structure
than the Guided Projects. You will need to spend more time designing the code
you write and consider how it affects other parts of the program. You will also
need to write about your work, explaining and assessing the changes you made to
the program.</p>
<p>I expect you to complete every programming task and address every writeup
question before you submit your work. I do not expect your work to be perfect,
but I do expect it to be finished and result in a runnable program. If you are
confused by some of the directions, then you need to ask me about them as early
as possible.</p>
<h2 id="review-1"><a class="header" href="#review-1">Review</a></h2>
<p>I will read and test your submission before providing feedback. If you
completed every task as instructed, fully answered every writeup question, and
included every deliverable with your submission, then the assignment is
<strong>complete</strong>. It doesn't matter if I disagree with your opinions in the
write-up or think you should have written part of the program differently. All
of my feedback in the project review will be aimed at helping you improve as a
programmer, and it has no bearing on any grade.</p>
<p>If you skip any tasks, forget to include a deliverable, or do not fully address
each writeup question, then your work is <strong>incomplete</strong>. I will provide minimal
feedback to indicate what part(s) of the assignment are missing, and you can
resubmit the assignment. If you resubmit after the deadline, then you will
incur the usual late penalty specified by your grade contract. An incomplete
submission, even if accidental, does not entitle you to extra time. If you are
not confident that you have followed the assignment directions correctly, then
you can always ask me to check your work during office hours or submit a week
or two early to leave time for a revision.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="final-project"><a class="header" href="#final-project">Final Project</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>Final Project</strong> is an open-ended project and works similarly to an
Expanded Project. However, there are a few differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will start from scratch and design the entire program.</li>
<li>You <em>must</em> submit a proposal (as you would for alternative tasks in an
Expanded Project), and you must receive approval at least a week before you
can turn in the assignment. The Final Project proposal will include
additional information about the Learning Objectives your project should
cover.</li>
<li>You can work in a group, but group projects will have additional
requirements. I will also expect them to be larger in scope than a typical
solo project.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="grading"><a class="header" href="#grading">Grading</a></h1>

</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="contract-grading"><a class="header" href="#contract-grading">Contract Grading</a></h1>
<p>Contract grading is a form of &quot;labor-based grading.&quot; You can find plenty of
articles about labor-based grading and grade contracts if you want to search
for it. Here's one that was easy to find and that I think explains the concept
well: <a href="https://cep.barnard.edu/labor-based-grading">https://cep.barnard.edu/labor-based-grading</a>. There's also a link to an
example contract in that webpage. My implementation will differ a little from
what they describe, but my goals are mostly the same.</p>
<h2 id="why-grade-contracts"><a class="header" href="#why-grade-contracts">Why Grade Contracts?</a></h2>
<p>The author of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I9hjemH4qo5nQYa89WW-3udW-oz4cYDoly25m8yaiik/edit?usp=sharing">example grade
contract</a>
shown in the Bernard College webpage gives an excellent explanation of why they
prefer contract grading over traditional grades. I recommend reading that if
you want a more thorough explanation than what I've written here.</p>
<p>I'll try to summarize why I dislike traditional grading systems and think grade
contracts address some (but not all) of the problems with grades.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grades are not a good source of feedback.</strong> They aren't necessary for
feedback, and they don't tell you much. I'd rather write comments explaining
what I think you did well, pointing out mistakes and areas for improvement,
and suggesting how you can improve.</li>
<li><strong>The grade contracts are more transparent than traditional grades.</strong> You
know exactly which assignments you need to complete to receive a particular
grade. If I've designed and written my assignments well, then you'll know
exactly what I expect and can determine for yourself when you've met those
requirements.</li>
<li><strong>The grade contract deemphasizes grades.</strong> I don't grade individual
assignments. I need to determine if you completed the assignment as
instructed, so I am still enforcing a standard, but beyond that I am not
penalizing you based on the quality of your work. You are a student, not a
professional software developer, and I expect you to make a lot of mistakes.
This is a necessary part of learning, and I don't want to punish you for it
with lower grades. I'd rather encourage mistakes and help you learn from
them.</li>
</ul>
<p>One other note: graded exams, quizzes, and similar assessments don't work well
with grade contracts, or at least not with the style of contract I'm using.
This means we won't have any exams or quizzes in this class, with the possible
exception of ungraded practice quizzes. This also means there is no
midterm/final exam.</p>

<h2 id="modifying-a-grade-contract"><a class="header" href="#modifying-a-grade-contract">Modifying a Grade Contract</a></h2>
<p>Most students will use one of the default contracts. However, you may want or
need to alter your contract in some way. In that case, discuss your proposed
changes to the contract with me before you submit the modified contract. You
can submit a modified contract as your initial grade contract, or you can ask
to change to a modified contract at any point during the semester. I am under
no obligation to approve your modifications, but I will try to work with you to
find a compromise that works for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>If you make changes to the default grade contract, then you must explain
these modifications in your contract and clearly mark all changes (for example,
by highlighting them).</strong> If you do not do this, then your modified contract is
invalid and I will hold you to the default contract for your chosen grade.</p>
<p>Some reasons you may want to alter the default contract:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need an accommodation that conflicts with one of the contract
requirements or one of the policies in this syllabus.</li>
<li>You want to replace an assignment from the contract. You may dislike a
particular assignment or have a different idea that you think would be more
interesting to you. Whatever the reason, I'm open to replacing assignments or
groups of assignments on a case by case basis. Keep in mind that it will be
up to you to give me a detailed proposal for the alternative assignment and
demonstrate that it meets the same objectives as the assignment(s) it would
replace. This option will often entail more work from you, but if it makes
the projects more fun then it's probably worth that extra effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few examples where a modified contract would <strong>not</strong> be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to remove an assignment from the contract without replacing it. If
you want less work, then you can choose a contract that requires less work.
If you're not even willing to do the guided projects in the C contract, then
you should drop this class.</li>
<li>You want to propose an A- or other compromise contract that just cuts some of
the assignments from a higher contract. The contracts already specify grade
penalties for skipping certain assignments.</li>
<li>You want to add extra credit to make up for incomplete or late work. It makes
no sense to skip assignments and then propose extra work to do instead. Just
do the work in the contract or propose an alternative before that work is
due.</li>
<li>You wish to be exempt from a class policy but do not have a compelling reason
for the exemption.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to modify the grade contract but aren't sure whether I would allow
your proposed changes, just ask me about it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="additional-notes"><a class="header" href="#additional-notes">Additional Notes</a></h1>
<p>Some additional information about the grade contracts that should answer common
questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no 100/A+ contract. The highest letter grade you can earn at
Quinnipiac is an A, not an A+
(<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/academics/grading-system/">https://catalog.qu.edu/academics/grading-system/</a>). The reason the contract
specifies a 95 is so that the penalties have a consistent impact in each of
the three contracts. The actual number doesn't go on your transcript, just
the letter grade.</li>
<li>I do not round grades, which may matter if you lose a fraction of a point
somewhere. For example, a 72.75 does not meet the minimum 73 for a C and
would therefore be a C-.</li>
<li>There is no extra credit. You choose what grade you want and you know what
work is required. Do that work and you get that grade. Don't do that work and
you get a lower grade. That's how this system works.</li>
<li>There is no partial credit for partially-finished assignments, and I will not
change the late penalties because you were almost on-time or almost within
the 48-hour late window. You must complete the entire assignment for it to
count, and you must submit it on time to avoid a late penalty. If you're
having trouble, then please ask me or a tutor for help!</li>
<li>I tried to set the penalties and deadlines so that it will always make sense
to prioritize the Guided Projects over the harder assignments if you are
struggling to finish all of your work. They cover the essential skills we
want you to learn in CSC110, so if you only do some of the assignments then
you should do the Guided Projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about the grade contracts that aren't answered in the
syllabus, or if you find something in them unclear or confusing, please don't
hesitate to ask me about it! Most students aren't used to this type of grading
system, so I want to address all of your questions and concerns before you
submit a contract.</p>

<p>Additionally, I want to say that your mental and physical health are more
important than your classes. If you're struggling with class due to mental
health issues or notice that you're developing unhealthy habits to cope with
your academic workload, then please talk to someone as early as possible. I'll
always try to work with you if you tell me about a problem you're dealing with,

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="class-policies"><a class="header" href="#class-policies">Class Policies</a></h1>

</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="late-work-and-extensions"><a class="header" href="#late-work-and-extensions">Late Work and Extensions</a></h1>
<p>The latest I will accept any assignment submissions is the last day of classes
shown in the <a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/general-information/academic-calendar/">Academic
Calendar</a>. If an
assignment is not <strong>complete</strong> and submitted before this deadline, then the
assignment will count as <strong>incomplete</strong> on your grade contract.</p>
<p>Some assignments may have deadlines before the last day of classes. The
contracts specify a late penalty for missing this deadline, and you cannot
submit them at all after the last day of classes.</p>
<p>Some assignments do not specify a deadline, but they may have other
constraints. For example, you may need to give a presentation during a class
meeting as part of an assignment. If you miss your last opportunity to finish
such an assignment, then it will count as <strong>incomplete</strong> on your grade
contract.</p>
<h2 id="extensions"><a class="header" href="#extensions">Extensions</a></h2>
<p>In rare cases, I will allow extra time to complete an assignment. You can email
me to ask for a deadline extension if you believe one is appropriate in your
situation. Your email should include an explanation of why you need the
extension, a new proposed deadline, and your current progress on the
assignment. Be sure to send me your code and any other material you've created
so far.</p>
<p>I have some expectations if you are requesting an extension:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've demonstrated that you read this policy by including the information I
asked for.</li>
<li>If you're having trouble with the assignment, then you're taking steps to get
help. Most likely this would include seeing a tutor and/or going to office
hours.</li>
<li>If it's close to (within a week of) the deadline, then you have already
finished the majority of the assignment.</li>
<li>If it's after the deadline, then you have a compelling reason that you were
not able to contact me earlier and can provide some form of documentation to
support this.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will not extend any deadlines past the last day of classes unless I am giving
you a final grade of Incomplete as defined in the university's <a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/academics/grading-system/">grading
system</a>.</p>
<h2 id="advice"><a class="header" href="#advice">Advice</a></h2>
<p>If you struggle with deadlines or time management, then I can offer some
advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start your work early. You have six to nine assignments to complete depending
on your grade contract, and you probably won't be ready to start them until
week 3. That's one to two weeks per assignment. It's not a big workload if
you spread it out, but it will be overwhelming if you let it pile up.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlines in this class are not targets.</strong> Time estimation is difficult,
and it's easy to underestimate how long an assignment will take. If you plan
to submit something on the due date, then you may be unable to finish on
time. Aim to submit work at least a week before it is due, and then use the
extra week to deal with unexpected problems.</li>
<li>There are people you can talk to if you need help. Talk to them when you
<em>start</em> having trouble; don't wait until you feel hopelessly stuck or
overwhelmed. If you do start feeling overwhelmed or hopelessly stuck, then
it's even more important that you talk to someone right away!
<ul>
<li>I'm available in person during office hours and by email or appointment
(for remote meetings) outside of office hours.</li>
<li>The Learning Commons employs peer tutors who can help you with this
class.</li>
<li>Your Academic Coach can be reached by email and is available by
appointment. They may not be able to help you with your code, but they're
a great person to talk to if you're struggling with time management or
adjusting to a college environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep backups of your work in case you have a problem with your computer.
Google Drive and Dropbox both have free plans, and I believe you can access
OneDrive through the school.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="academic-integrity-ai-policy"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-ai-policy">Academic Integrity (AI) Policy</a></h1>
<p>This section assumes you understand the school's AI policy. I want to cover
some important details about how it applies in our class.</p>
<h2 id="permission-to-share-and-discuss-work"><a class="header" href="#permission-to-share-and-discuss-work">Permission to Share and Discuss Work</a></h2>
<p>I consider it <em>very</em> important that you feel comfortable discussing assignments
with other students. Your peers can be an excellent source of help and
feedback, and your own insights and feedback can be incredibly valuable to
them. To ensure that the school's AI policy does not penalize you for this, I
give you explicit permission to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may share any work you create for this class with anybody, including your
classmates.</li>
<li>You may publicly post work you create for this class.</li>
<li>You may use work you originally created for this class in an assignment for
another class as long as you get the other instructor's explicit written
permission first.</li>
<li>You may discuss assignments from this class with anybody. You may ask anybody
for help with them and view their work if they're willing to share it with
you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, you own all the work you do for this class, and that means you can
decide what you do with it. However, I need to clarify that this permission
does not extend to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not share work or post it publicly for the purpose of helping someone
else violate the school's AI policy. This includes if somebody asks you for
your work and informs you that they plan to copy it before you share the work
with them. This type of action is considered &quot;facilitation&quot; under the
school's AI policy.</li>
<li>You may not use work that you originally created for another class in any of
your assignments for this class without the explicit permission of both me
and the other class's instructor. The permission granted previously only
applies to reusing work <em>from</em> this class in another class, and you would
still need permission from that class's instructor. If you are ever unsure,
just ask me and the other instructor.</li>
<li>You may not copy your work from other people or from a large language model
(an &quot;AI&quot;). I'll cover this in more detail in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not consider you responsible for anyone's misuse of material that you
shared in good faith. I will always take your word regarding how you meant for
or expected your work to be used unless I have strong evidence that contradicts
you. If there's ever a question of whether you had permission to share work
from this class, please contact me and I will vouch for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-counts-as-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#what-counts-as-plagiarism">What Counts as Plagiarism?</a></h2>
<p>First and most important: <strong>in any situation where you have doubts or are
unsure whether something is allowed, ask me.</strong> It's always okay to ask whether
you <em>can</em> do something, and this is the best way to be sure that I won't treat
it as an AI violation.</p>
<p>This section exists for two reasons: to make it easier for someone who has
genuine questions to determine whether an action qualifies as cheating, and to
give me something to point to if somebody claims they didn't know their actions
qualified as cheating. Going through a series of flimsy excuses is one of the
most tedious parts of handling an AI violation, so I'd like to be thorough here
and save myself some trouble later.</p>
<p>The vast majority of AI violations that occur in this class involve plagiarism
on programming assignments, so that's what I will focus on. To keep my
descriptions short, I'll be using &quot;<strong>other work</strong>&quot; to refer to any work that
was created by somebody other than you or by an LLM (such as ChatGPT). The
following actions will nearly always qualify as cheating and/or plagiarism
(I'll note exceptions later):</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying the <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part, whether by copying the file,
copying and pasting the file's contents, or viewing the file and retyping the
same information by hand. Modifying the <strong>other work</strong> after copying it,
whether to disguise the plagiarism or &quot;make it your own&quot; does not change the
fact that it was copied. What matters is whether you copied work, not how you
copied it or what you did before or after copying it.</li>
<li>Paraphrasing the <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part. This is not meaningfully
different from copying, and it's often an attempt to disguise the copying and
provide some plausible deniability if caught.</li>
<li>Using the other work as a reference when creating your own work. This
normally ends up with you copying or paraphrasing as described above, but I
mention it because it's another common excuse.</li>
<li>Doing your work under the direction of another person. It's okay to talk to
someone about your work while you're working, but it's not okay to let them
dictate the code to you. If you're mostly writing what someone else tells you
to write, then you are not doing your own work. Try talking to them about
your problem, take some notes, and then go fix the problem after you're done
talking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions to the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use any material that I intentionally provide you (whether it's in my
notes, starter code, the assignment, or something I showed during class)
as-is or with modifications in your own work. I gave you that material so you
could use it, and you don't need to remind me about this. You can still
document your use of starter code or other resources that I provided if you
want to, it's just not necessary when submitting it in this class. If you
show the work outside of this class, then you'll probably want to be more
explicit about which parts you wrote yourself because that is no longer
obvious from context.</li>
<li>If you want to copy or paraphrase a portion of work from another source, then
you can as long as you do the following:
<ul>
<li>Discuss it with me first and get my permission to use the other work.</li>
<li>Clearly state which outside sources you used and provide a reliable link
or other means to access those sources.</li>
<li>Take great care to show what was taken from the other source and what is
your own original work. It should be immediately obvious to anyone
viewing your work which parts are from other sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two general rules I use if someone appears to have plagiarized but claims they
did not:</p>
<ul>
<li>If large sections of your code are identical or nearly identical to existing
code, then it isn't your work. If you are writing your own code and following
the guidelines I provide in this policy, then you should always end up with
significantly different code on all but the simplest programs.</li>
<li>If you don't understand your code and cannot explain how it works, then it
isn't your work. You should not be writing code that you don't understand,
and you are not going to accidentally write a working program that solves a
specific problem without some understanding of the code you're writing. If
your code doesn't appear to be something you realistically could have written
and you cannot explain how it works, then I will not accept it for an
assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism">Retaking this Class and Self-Plagiarism</a></h3>
<p>If you are retaking this class, then I expect you to complete every assignment
from scratch without reusing any of your old work. Reusing work from the last
time you took this class would be equivalent to reusing work you completed for
a different class. As stated earlier in this policy, you <strong>do not</strong> have my
permission to do this.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-and-llms"><a class="header" href="#chatgpt-and-llms">ChatGPT and LLMs</a></h2>
<p>You're free to discuss assignments with LLMs such as ChatGPT. However, I do not
recommend using them too heavily, and I want to warn you about some of their
limitations before I get into how they pertain to academic integrity. Despite
the colloquial term &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; these tools are not intelligent
and do not understand the conversation they are having with you. They are
complex algorithms running on powerful hardware, and they are very good at one
thing: using their training data to produce text that looks like something a
human might write in the context of your conversation. LLMs are prone to
hallucinating (making up false information), and they do not know when they are
hallucinating. If you don't understand the topic you're discussing well enough
to critically evaluate what ChatGPT tells you, then I think you're better off
talking to a human who does understand the topic.</p>
<p>I have a simple rule for how you may use material generated by an LLM: treat
anything it writes the way you would treat information you found by searching
the internet or information that someone else gave you. It is not your work,
and all of the restrictions I've already stated regarding &quot;other work&quot; apply.
You should also avoid asking an LLM to do something that you would not be
allowed to ask a human to do. Don't ask ChatGPT to rewrite or fix your work for
you. This would qualify as cheating. Instead, ask it questions so that you can
understand how to fix your work, and then <em>fix it yourself</em>.</p>
<p>If you are using ChatGPT for help with an assignment, then please save that
conversation so you can share it with me or the AI Office if your work is
called into question. This is an easy way to prove you used the tool
appropriately, and if you cannot or will not provide that evidence then I will
not give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h2 id="consequences-for-ai-violations"><a class="header" href="#consequences-for-ai-violations">Consequences for AI Violations</a></h2>
<p>Sanctions for AI violations are determined either by joint resolution, case
review, or a hearing. In a joint resolution, I must agree to any proposed
consequences, and in a case review or hearing I will still be consulted about
appropriate consequences. This section covers what I believe are appropriate
consequences <em>on a first offense</em> for most AI violations.</p>
<p>If you plagiarize, cheat, or otherwise violate the AI policy with work you
submit for an assignment, then under no circumstances will I consider it
appropriate to give you any credit for the assignment or allow you to attempt
the assignment again. This is the penalty stipulated in the grade contract for
not completing the entire assignment, not the penalty for cheating. If you
copied or cheated on even a small portion of the assignment, <strong>then you did not
complete the entire assignment</strong>; you completed <em>some</em> of the assignment and
then copied the remaining work. To give any credit would be a reward for
violating the AI policy.</p>
<p>In addition to enforcing the grade contract's penalty for incomplete work, I
consider the following penalties to be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>In cases of cheating on only a small part (let's say under ten percent) of
one or two assignments, an <em>additional</em> final grade penalty equal to half of
each assignment's incomplete penalty.</li>
<li>In more significant cases of cheating on a single assignment, an <em>additional</em>
final grade penalty equal to the assignment's incomplete penalty.</li>
<li>In cases of cheating on multiple assignments, a failing grade in the class.</li>
</ul>
<p>These additional penalties cannot be removed by changing your grade contract.
If you cheat on a project for the B contract, then the additional penalty will
still apply if you change to the C contract.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lab"><a class="header" href="#lab">Lab</a></h1>
<p>The lab is a separate class from the lecture. Depending on how many sections
there are and who's teaching the classes that semester, you may have me for the
lab, the lecture, or both.</p>
<p>Whichever classes you're taking with me, here are a few things you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li>You receive a separate final grade in each class, and they may or may not be
the same. Only your work for the lecture affects your grade in the lecture,
and only your work in the lab affects your grade in the lab. Passing one
class doesn't guarantee you'll pass the other.</li>
<li>The lab and lecture each have their own Blackboard page. I've combined my lab
and lecture syllabi into this one document for convenience, so you'll see the
same syllabus from me on both of my Blackboard pages. If you're taking one of
these classes with someone else, then make sure you read their syllabus. My
syllabus does not apply to their classes.</li>
<li>If you are not taking the lab with me, then you can ignore the whole lab
section of this syllabus. If you are only taking the lab with me, then the
following parts of the main syllabus are still relevant to you:
<ul>
<li><a href="./course_info.html">Course Information</a></li>
<li><a href="./revisions.html">Syllabus Revisions</a></li>
<li><a href="./communication.html">Communication and Office Hours</a></li>
<li><a href="./university_policies.html">University Policies</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do not require any additional textbooks or other material for the lab. You
will need nothing other than your computer, the material you receive in the
lecture, and the material I give you for each lab assignment.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lab-assignments"><a class="header" href="#lab-assignments">Lab Assignments</a></h1>
<p>I plan on giving ten lab assignments during the semester (this number was later
reduced to eight total assignments). Lab assignments will typically have the
following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group activity to complete with other students in the lab, which may
involve writing code or producing other material that should be shared among
all group members. Each group member should turn in a copy of this group
work, ensuring that the names of everyone in the group are listed in each
file/document.</li>
<li>A written portion to be completed <em>individually</em>. You are free to discuss the
questions with your group, but you must write your own answers.</li>
<li>The activity must be completed during class, and all work must be submitted
on Blackboard by the end of the lab meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="make-up-classes"><a class="header" href="#make-up-classes">Make-Up Classes</a></h2>
<p>I have scheduled four of our class meetings as make-up classes. You may
complete/redo a single missed or incomplete lab assignment per week either
during a designated make-up class or during my in-person office hours before
the lab. Depending on why you did not receive credit for the assignment, I may
require that you redo both the activity and the write-up from the beginning.</p>
<p>I cannot guarantee we will have all four make-up classes. If I need to cancel a
class meeting, then I will most likely cut one of the make-up days from our
schedule. Do not skip labs frivilously and plan to complete them on the next
make-up day; you may find the make-up day has been cut and you are no longer
able to complete every assignment.</p>
<p>If you have completed every lab so far, then feel free to skip a make-up class
or use the meeting for other work.</p>
<h2 id="lab-assignment-completion"><a class="header" href="#lab-assignment-completion">Lab Assignment Completion</a></h2>
<p>Lab assignments are not graded. Each assignment is marked as either complete or
incomplete:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>complete</strong> assignment submission includes all required materials and
demonstrates that you followed all directions during the lab activity. It
must be submitted by the end of the class meeting in which it was scheduled
or during a make-up class.</li>
<li>An <strong>incomplete</strong> assignment may be missing required materials, may not
demonstrate that you completed the activity as directed, or may not have been
submitted due to an absence or failure to finish the activity in the allotted
time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that the lab's purpose is to practice applying material from the
lecture and to reflect on that material by writing about it. There is no wrong
way to do this as long as you complete the entire practice activity and answer
every question in the write-up. I don't care about the &quot;correct&quot; code or the
&quot;correct&quot; answers to the write-up questions, I only care about <em>your</em> code and
<em>your</em> answers to the write-up questions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lab-grades"><a class="header" href="#lab-grades">Lab Grades</a></h1>
<p>Your grade in the lab is determined by the number of lab assignments you
complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: eight complete labs</li>
<li>B: seven complete labs </li>
<li>C: six complete labs </li>
<li>D: five complete labs </li>
<li>F: four or fewer complete labs</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no in-between grades and no partial credit for lab assignments; each
lab is either complete or incomplete. The highest letter grade you can receive
is an A because the <a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/academics/grading-system/">university's grading
system</a> does not allow for an
A+ or any other grade above an A. I did not include numeric scores with the
letter grades because I only send a letter grade to the registrar. A numeric
score would only matter if it affected your letter grade, which is not possible
with this class's grading system.</p>
<p>Unlike the lecture, I do not feel a grade contract makes sense for the lab.
However, I have still tried to do what I can to de-emphasize and simplify
grades and instead emphasize the learning process. I do not grade individual
assignments, and I only consider whether the required work was completed on
time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lab-policies"><a class="header" href="#lab-policies">Lab Policies</a></h1>
<p>Most of the policies outside the lab portion of this syllabus still apply to
the lab. There are a few changes and additional considerations for the lab,
which I will note here.</p>
<h2 id="attendance"><a class="header" href="#attendance">Attendance</a></h2>
<p>You're still free to miss class when needed and should avoid coming to class if
you are sick, but attendance is necessary to complete the lab assignments. It's
up to you to make sure you're attending enough classes to finish all of the
assignments, and if you need to miss a significant amount of class for some
reason then you should get in touch with me as early as possible. I will not
allow additional make-up assignments without a compelling reason <em>and prompt
communication from you about the circumstances that require the make-up
assignments</em>. If you wait and email me at the end of the semester to make up
five missed labs, then expect me to just say no.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity-1"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-1">Academic Integrity</a></h2>
<p>Here is a list of DOs and DON'Ts for the lab assignments:</p>
<ul>
<li>DO work on the activity portion with a group and share all work from the
activity with the rest of your group.</li>
<li>DO include all of the group work when you submit the lab assignment.</li>
<li>DO include the names of all group members on the group work you submit.</li>
<li>DO discuss write-up questions with other students as much as you want. Their
opinions are valuable and may help you better understand the activity.</li>
<li>DON'T copy work from another group, the internet, an LLM, or other sources.
All submitted <em>group work</em> must consist of material I gave you and material
that you and your group created during the activity.</li>
<li>DON'T copy answers to the written portion of the assignment, have somebody
else write them for you, or write them collectively with your group. The
written portion is to be completed on your own, and it should only consist of
<em>your</em> answers to these questions.</li>
<li>DON'T use ChatGPT or another LLM to write or fix your answers to the written
portion of the assignment. The write-up should only consist of your own
writing. I'm only interested in hearing <em>your</em> thoughts about the activity,
and I don't care if you make mistakes as long as you can express your
thoughts coherently in English.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope the way I designed this class removes most incentives to cheat. However,
if I do have to handle an AI violation then I will use the standard penalties
listed below. They are different from the penalties listed in the main AI
policy for the lecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>I still consider it non-negotiable that you receive no credit for an
assignment on which you cheat and are not allowed to redo the assignment.</li>
<li>I will count cheating as two incomplete lab assignments rather than one when
calculating your final grade. This means cheating on one lab and completing
all the others will result in a C (whereas just skipping that assignment
would give you a B), and cheating on two or more assignments will result in
an F.</li>
</ul>
